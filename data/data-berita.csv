Pertamina harus tanggung jawab,"" kata dia dalam keterangan di Jakarta Sabtu, 4 Maret 2024.Rofik mengatakan Pertamina serta pihak terkait harus memastikan keselamatan dan keamanan warga yang tinggal di sekitar lokasi.Pipa BBM yang terbakar itu merupakan bagian dari Terminal Bahan Bakar Minyak (TBBM) Plumpang. TBBM Plumpang dinilai sebagai salah satu terminal BBM terpenting di Indonesia, sehingga Rofik juga menegaskan Pertamina harus memastikan pasokan bahan bakar minyak tetap aman meski ada insiden tersebut.""Plumpang menyuplai sekitar 20 persen kebutuhan BBM harian di Indonesia, atau sekitar 25 persen dari total kebutuhan SPBU Pertamina. Maka tindakan selanjutnya adalah bagaimana memastikan suplai BBM tidak terganggu,"" katanya.Rofik juga menyinggung kejadian kilang minyak milik Pertamina yang sebelumnya pernah terjadi kejadian serupa, seperti Kilang Balikpapan pada Maret 2022 lalu. Terhitung 2 tahun terakhir ini, kata dia, sudah 5 fasilitas migas milik Pertamina mengalami insiden kebakaran.""Menyayangkan terjadinya musibah kebakaran ini, apalagi insiden kebakaran bukan kali pertama di fasilitas migas, ini terus berulang. Pertamina harus benahi sistem pengamanan dan SOP yang ada,"" kata dia.Rofik mengharapkan adanya pembenahan menyeluruh terhadap sistem pengamanan serta SOP yang ada dalam lingkup Pertamina untuk mengamankan baik fasilitas migas, pekerja, maupun masyarakat sekitar. Menurutnya pembenahan diperlukan agar Pertamina tidak abai terhadap aspek pengamanan fasilitas migas.""Investigasi menyeluruh dan tuntas, serta meminta komitmen Pertamina memperbaiki sistem keamanan kilang minyak maupun depo BBM, seringnya kebakaran terjadi mengindikasikan Pertamina abai terhadap pengamanan kilang,"" ujarnya.Pilihan Editor:Profil Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Pemasok 20 Persen Pasokan

M. Hidayat Nur Wahid MA., atau HNW menerima kunjungan perwakilan korban kasus biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel, yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia. Pertemuan tersebut berlangsung di Ruang Kerja Wakil Ketua MPR Gedung Nusantara III Komplek Senayan, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Delegasi Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia dipimpin Abdul Rasyid SIQ, S. Thi, M.Si., Salah satu tujuan Kedatangan perwakilan mereka bertemu HNW, adalah untuk meminta bantuan dan dukungan terkait Putusan Kasasi Mahkamah Agung Nomor: 365 PK/Pid.Sus/2022 tanggal 23 Mei 2022.Dalam PK, itu Mahkamah Agung (MA) memutuskan bahwa seluruh aset dalam kasus PT First Anugerah Karya Wisata (First Travel) dikembalikan ke jamaah atau korban. Tapi, hingga kini keputusan tersebut belum bisa dieksekusi.Bahkan, Kejaksaan Negeri (Kejari) Depok selaku eksekutor tengah menunggu putusan lengkap Peninjauan Kembali (PK) perkara tersebut. Kepada HNW, Abdul Rasyid mengatakan, para calon jamaah Umroh berharap bisa diberangkatkan ke tanah suci Mekah untuk melaksanakan Ibadah Umroh.""Keberangkatan ke Mekah, lebih penting dibanding menerima pengembalian biaya umroh yang telah kami bayarkan pada 2016-2017,"" kata Abdul.Ia berharap, pemerintah dalam hal ini kementerian agama membantu calon jamaah Umroh. Kami berharap pemerintah hadir dalam perkara ini, dan bertanggungjawab memberangkatkan seluruh jamaah umroh korban first Travel, sebagaimana pernah mereka janjikan, ujar Abdul.Wakil Ketua MPR Hidayat Nur Wahid menyampaikan rasa prihatin dan ikut bersimpati terhadap jamaah umroh yang gagal diberangkatkan biro perjalanan Haji dan Umroh First Travel. HNW memahami, betapa kecewa dan sedihnya jamaah yang gagal diberangkatkan.Apalagi, tidak sedikit diantara mereka yang menabung selama bertahun-tahun, mengumpulkan uang untuk membayar biaya umroh. Persoalan Umroh, menurut HNW kerap dibahas oleh Komisi VIII DPR RI dengan pihak Kementerian Agama.Bahkan, untuk menjamin agar ibadah umroh bisa berjalan dengan baik, Komisi VIII mengusulkan selain adanya Dirjen Penyelenggaraan Haji juga Umroh. Sayangnya persoalan haji lebih mendapat perhatian dibanding ibadah Umroh.Ini memang belum adil, pemerintah masih memberikan perhatiannya lebih besar kepada persoalan haji dari pada persoalan calon jemaah Umroh, kata HNW.Hidayat mendukung calon jamaah Umroh yang tergabung dalam Paguyuban First Travel Indonesia, tetap berusaha menuntut haknya agar bisa melaksanakan ibadah umroh. Apalagi, mereka pernah dijanjikan oleh Kementerian Agama, untuk diberangkatkan Umroh jika persoalan hukumnya telah inkracht.Perwakilan calon jemaah Umroh pun menyampaikan apresiasi dan terimakasih kepada HNW dengan berbagai saran konstruktif dan kesediaannya membantu para calon jemaah umroh.

Sehingga, dapat menginspirasi klub-klub otomotif lainnya untuk memberikan kontribusi terbaik bagi kehidupan sosial kemasyarakatan.""Selamat kepada sahabat saya Ahmad Sahroni yang telah terpilih sebagai Ketua Umum HDCI periode 2023-2028 pada Musyawarah Nasional Luar Biasa tanggal 27-28 Januari 2023 di Bali,"" kata Bamsoet saat membuka Rapat Kerja Nasional (Rakernas) HDCI dan pelantikan pengurus pusat HDCI periode 2023-2028 di Semarang, Jumat malam, 3 Maret 2023.Bamsoet yakin dan percaya dengan pengalaman dan wawasan organisasi yang luas, kemampuan membangun networking yang handal, serta kecintaan yang tulus pada dunia otomotif, Ahmad Sahroni memiliki segala kualifikasi. ""Dan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan untuk memimpin dan memajukan organisasi HDCI,"" ujar Bamsoet.Hadir antara lain Ketua Umum HDCI Ahmad Sahroni, Kakorlantas Polri Irjen Pol. Firman Santyabudi, Wakapolda Jawa Tengah Brigjen Pol. Abiyoso Seno Aji, Dirjen Administrasi Hukum Umum Kemenkumham Cahyo Rahadian Muzhar, Kajati DKI Jakarta Reda Manthovani dan Kajati Jawa Tengah I Made Suarnawan.Ketua DPR RI ke-20 dan mantan Ketua Komisi III DPR RI bidang Hukum, HAM, dan Keamanan ini menjelaskan, sejak didirikan pada 28 Mei 1990, HDCI terus tumbuh dan berkembang hingga memiliki puluhan ribu anggota yang tersebar di seluruh wilayah nusantara. Namun, HDCI 'besar' bukan hanya karena jumlah anggotanya.Tapi, karena kiprah dan kontribusinya dalam kehidupan masyarakat, khususnya melalui berbagai aksi sosial kemanusiaan yang diprakarsainya. ""Pada berbagai event yang diselenggarakan oleh HDCI, hampir selalu dibarengi dengan agenda bakti sosial. Bahkan pada acara pelantikan pengurus dan Rakernas kali ini, juga disertai dengan pemberian tanda kasih bagi ribuan anak yatim,"" kata Bamsoet.Wakil Ketua Umum Partai Golkar dan Kepala Badan Hubungan Penegakan Hukum, Pertahanan dan Keamanan KADIN Indonesia ini mengatakan, kiprah positif HDCI tidak hanya dirasakan dari maraknya berbagai aksi sosial yang dilakukan. Tetapi, juga pada keberpihakan dan dukungan HDCI untuk memajukan perekonomian masyarakat.""Salah satunya melalui implementasi konsep sport automotive tourism yang menyatukan aktivitas otomotif dengan upaya memajukan sektor pariwisata, sehingga dapat mendorong geliat perekonomian rakyat, khususnya para pelaku UMKM di daerah,"" ujar Bamsoet.Ketua Umum Pengurus Besar Keluarga Olahraga Tarung Derajat dan Wakil Ketua Umum Pemuda Pancasila menilai kiprah dan kontribusi HDCI yang telah dilakukan memiliki makna mendalam, khususnya ditengah masih adanya pandangan negatif dari sebagian masyarakat terhadap keberadaan klub motor besar. Eksistensi klub motor besar dipandang sebagai simbol eksklusivisme yang telah membentuk sekat dan kelas sosial yang membentangkan jarak dengan kelompok masyarakat lainnya.""Karena itu, saya sangat mengapresiasi komitmen Ahmad Sahroni beserta segenap jajaran pengurus HDCI, untuk menjadikan organisasi HDCI sebagai pelayan, pelindung, dan pemersatu,"" ujarnya.Menurutnya, komitmen ini mengisyaratkan adanya semangat inklusivitas, untuk merangkul semua kalangan.

Namun, Sri Mulyani menegaskan untuk terus membangun daerah secara berkelanjutan. Hal ini penting agar ke depan, tidak ada lagi terminologi daerah terpencil, daerah terluar dan daerah tertinggal di Indonesia, ujarnya.Ia melanjutkan, PT SMI memiliki peran yang sangat strategis dalam memenuhi kebutuhan pembiayaan pembangunan, sehingga diharapkan transformasi PT SMI menjadi Development Financial Institution menjadi ladang untuk menciptakan jejak peninggalan bagi pembangunan.Direktur Utama PT SMI Edwin Syahruzad memberi paparan kepada Menteri Keuangan mengenai capaian kinerja serta milestone yang berhasil dijalankan selama 14 tahun berdirinya PT SMI.Dalam mencapai target ini, sejak pendiriannya pada tahun 2009, PT SMI telah melaksanakan berbagai inovasi dan kreasi pembiayaan infrastruktur dalam rangka menjadi katalis pembiayaan pembangunan nasional melalui tiga pilar bisnis utama yaitu Pembiayaan dan Investasi, Jasa Konsultasi dan Pengembangan Proyek. Hal ini diukur dari keterlibatan PT SMI dalam pembiayaan 435 proyek infrastruktur dengan berbagai inovasi produk pembiayaan.Hingga tahun 2022, PT SMI terlibat dalam pembiayaan infrastruktur dengan total nilai proyek sebesar Rp 819,94 triliun yang menghasilkan multiplier effect 5,6 kali dari nilai total komitmen pembiayaan dan 26,87 kali dari modal disetor.Dalam menjalankan perannya sebagai katalis pembangunan Indonesia, PT SMI juga senantiasa aktif dalam mencari alternatif sumber pendanaan seperti penerbitan Green Bond dan Global Bond serta pelibatan dan kolaborasi dengan sektor privat pada sindikasi proyek-proyek infrastruktur. Inovasi dan inisiatif ini telah dan dapat terus mengoptimalkan leveraging terhadap asset PT SMI.Selama pandemi COVID-19, peran PT SMI terasa semakin besar. Sebagai alat countercyclical Pemerintah, PT SMI ikut bekerja keras untuk menanggulangi dampak perubahan situasi ekonomi di daerah yang signifikan melalui program pinjaman Pemulihan Ekonomi Nasional (PEN) Daerah.Edwin menyampaikan, ada 92 Pemerintah Daerah yang telah menerima manfaat pinjaman program PEN hingga Desember 2022, dengan total komitmen sebesar Rp 34,7 triliun. PT SMI telah berpartisipasi pada pembiayaan daerah sejak 2015, melalui engalihan aset dan peran Pusat Investasi Pemerintah sebagai lembaga pembiayaan untuk pemerintah daerah kepada PT SMI.Dalam penyaluran dana PEN, kami senantiasa menjaga integritas dan akuntabilitas. Salah satu inovasi yang kami lakukan untuk menjaganya adalah melalui transformasi digital pengajuan pinjaman daerah melalui Regional Financing System (ReFina), sehingga akuntabilitas dan transparansi dapat terukur.Sebagai informasi, ReFina meraih penghargaan Peringkat 1 Inovasi Terbaik dari Kementerian Keuangan pada Februari 2023.Dalam menjawab tantangan pembangunan ekonomi daerah yang memerlukan pemerataan akses antar daerah terhadap infrastruktur sesuai karakteristiknya, saat ini PT SMI sedang disiapkan untuk bertransformasi menjadi Lembaga Pembiayaan Pembangunan Nasional.Untuk menunjang proses transformasi tersebut salah satu inisiatif yang akan dibentuk oleh PT SMI pada ulang tahun ke-14 ini adalah peluncuran SMI Institute. Terdapat tiga program utama yang akan menjadi fokus, yaitu program research & fellowship, capacity building & training, serta knowledge sharing.Kami menyusun tiga program utama untuk pemerintah daerah sebagai pelengkap pembiayaan pembangunan daerah yang inklusif dan berkelanjutan ucap Edwin.Momentum Presidensi G20 Indonesia 2022 juga menjadi ajang PT SMI dalam menunjukkan kapabilitasnya untuk mendukung pemerintah demi mengatasi tantangan global khususnya dampak perubahan iklim (climate change).Kepercayaan Pemerintah untuk menunjuk PT SMI sebagai Country Platform Manager undalamtuk mengelola pembiayaan mekanisme transisi energi di Indonesia pada Presidensi G20 Indonesia 2022 di Bali merupakan bentuk apresiasi Kementerian Keuangan atas capaian platform SDG Indonesia One  sebuah platform blended finance untuk membiayai proyek-proyek adaptasi dan mitigasi perubahan iklim - yang telah dikelola oleh PT SMI sejak 2018.PT SMI sejauh ini telah berhasil meningkatkan reputasi Indonesia di mata dunia, melalui perannya sebagai Energy Transition Mechanism Country Platform Manager. Untuk itu, PT SMI perlu secara ambisius dan agresif melakukan tindak lanjut atas dukungan-dukungan yang diberikan kepada Indonesia untuk agenda transisi energi.Hingga Februari 2023, PT SMI telah bekerja sama dengan 17 lembaga mitra untuk menyusun strategi pembiayaan dan investasi transisi energi melalui dukungan-dukungan yang tersedia baik dalam bentuk dana komersil maupun non-komersil seperti dana hibah maupun bantuan teknis.Lembaga yang menjadi mitra PT SMI dalam perannya sebagai ETM Country Platform Manager terdiri dari lembaga multilateral, bilateral, bank, filantropi dan think tank. Edwin menambahkan, dalam menyusun skema pembiayaan dan investasi transisi energi di Indonesia, aspek lingkungan dan sosial merupakan prioritas.PT SMI bersama dengan Asian Development Bank telah menyusun Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment, dimana akan dilakukan audit, identifikasi risiko, dan penyiapan rencana mitigasi risiko dari aspek lingkungan dan sosial sebagai dasar rekomendasi skenario transisi energi. Ini dilakukan untuk mencapai tujuan transisi energi di Indonesia agar dapat dilakukan secara adil dan terjangkau ujar Edwin.Baru-baru ini, PT SMI sedang disiapkan oleh Pemerintah Indonesia melalui Kementerian Keuangan untuk mendukung pelaksanaan penyiapan proyek Ibu Kota Negara. PT SMI akan berperan strategis dalam penyusunan inovasi pembiayaan penyediaan infrastruktur terhadap Otorita Ibu Kota Negara.Kepercayaan Pemerintah terhadap PT SMI merupakan afirmasi terhadap kinerja PT SMI dalam menjalankan berbagai mandat penyiapan proyek untuk 20 proyek infrastruktur dari berbagai variasi sektor antara lain Rumah Sakit, Pengelolaan Limbah B3, Pengelolaan Sampah, Akses Broadband, Transportasi, dan Sistem Penyediaan Air Minum.Dalam menjalankan seluruh mandat dan kegiatan bisnisnya, integritas, akuntabilitas dan transparansi menjadi aspek yang selalu dijaga oleh PT SMI. Saat ini PT SMI telah tersertifikasi ISO 37001 Sistem Manajemen Anti Penyuapan, serta terus memperketat pengawasan melalui kerja sama dengan penegak hukum yaitu Komisi Pemberatasan Korupsi (KPK) dan Jaksa Agung Muda Bidang Perdata dan Tata Usaha Negara (JAMDATUN), serta lembaga negara lainnya seperti Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan (BPK), Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan (BPKP) dan Inspektorat Jenderal Kementerian Keuangan.Tentunya capaian prestasi-prestasi ini dilakukan dengan prinsip tata kelola perusahaan yang baik serta penyempurnaan kerangka manajemen risiko yang selalu mengikuti tantangan yang dihadapi. Hal ini membuat PT SMI selalu mejadi enabler dalam menjawab tantangan ekonomi global, nasional, dan daerah, Kami berkomitmen untuk terus melakukan inovasi, sinergi, dan kolaborasi dengan berbagai pihak dalam membangun negeri dan memenuhi kesejahteraan masyarakat Indonesia di masa sekarang maupun generasi mendatang.

88,tempo,Penundaan Pemilu 2024 Bisa Buat Jokowi 3 Periode? Ini Mereka yang Pernah Menyuarakan ,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/04/01/id_1099907/1099907_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698557/penundaan-pemilu-2024-bisa-buat-jokowi-3-periode-ini-mereka-yang-pernah-menyuarakan,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Wacana Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi 3 periode tak kunjung surut. Keputusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat mengetok palu yang berarti penundaan Pemilu 2024, mengindikasikan Jokowi kudu menjabat hingga 2025. Majelis Hakim tersebut meminta Komisi Pemilihan Umum atau KPU menunda Pemilu selama dua tahun empat bulan.Keputusan itu buntut laporan Partai Prima yang merasa dirugikan karena tak lolos sebagai partai peserta Pemilu 2024. PN Jakarta Pusat menyatakan KPU telah melakukan tindakan melawan hukum. Sebab itu, lembaga yang berwenang terhadap pemilihan eksekutif dan yudikatif itu diminta tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Berikut sejumlah deretan wacana Jokowi 3 periode yang pernah digaungkan sejumlah pihak:1. Guru asal Dumai Herifuddin DaulayPertengahan Desember 2022 lalu, Seorang guru di Dumai, Riau, Herifuddin Daulay, membangkitkan isu perpanjangan masa jabatan presiden. Dia mengajukan gugatan uji materiil terhadap aturan masa jabatan Presiden dan Wakil Presiden di Mahkamah Konstitusi. Gugatan ditujukan kepada Pasal 169 huruf n dan Pasal 227 huruf I Undang-Undang Nomor 7 Tahun 2017 tentang Pemilihan Umum alias UU Pemilu.Menurut Herifuddin, kedua pasal UU Pemilu bertentangan dengan UUD 1945. Dalam alasan permohonan, Herifuddin menilai telah ada kesalahan dalam teks Pasal 7 UUD 1945 yang mengatur masa jabatan Presiden dan Wakil Presiden selama 2 periode. Padahal, Pasal 7 inilah yang diturunkan menjadi UU Pemilu.Pemohon berkesimpulan bahwa lebih besar mudharat ketimbang manfaat dari adanya aturan pembatasan jabatan presiden, demikian bunyi salah satu poin alasan Herifuddin dalam perkara nomor 4/PUUXXI/2023 ini.2. Ketua Umum DPP APDESI Surta WijayaKetua Umum DPP Asosiasi Pemerintah Desa Indonesia atau APDESI Surta Wijaya juga pernah menyerukan dukungan Presiden Jokowi 3 periode. Seruan itu dikumandangkan olehnya saat aksi di Istora Senayan pada Selasa 29 Maret 2022 lalu. Pihaknya menilai Jokowi harus didukung menjabat tiga periode lantaran kepala desa merasa terbantu dengan pemerintahan Jokowi. Antara lain, kata dia, Jokowi telah mengabulkan tuntutan para kepala desa yakni mengubah aturan mekanisme gaji kepala desa dari tiga bulan sekali menjadi sebulan sekali.Setelah membuat pernyataan mendukung Jokowi 3 periode, Surta mendapat berbagai kecaman. Salah satunya dari Ketua Umum DPP APDESI, Arifin Abdul Majid. Menurutnya setelah pertemuan di Istora Senayan timbul gejolak di internal. Arifin mengatakan pihaknya tidak pernah menyatakan dukungan tiga periode untuk presiden dan meluruskan bahwa Apdesi yang sah berdasarkan SK Kementerian Hukum dan HAM adalah yang di bawah dirinya.3. Partai Bulan BintangPartai Bulan Bintang atau juga pernah mengembuskan isu Jokowi tiga periode. Hal itu terungkap saat Sekretaris Jenderal PBB Afriansyah Noor berpidato membuka Rapat Koordinasi Nasional partai itu di Kelapa Gading, Jakarta Utara pada Rabu, 11 Januari 2023. Yang paling cocok memimpin kita saat ini hanya Bapak Joko Widodo. Selebihnya belum ada, karena kami belum putuskan siapa, ungkap AfriansyahMenurutnya, bila undang-undang bisa secara konstitusional melanggengkan kekuasaan Jokowi, PBB pasti akan memilih kembali sang presiden. Karena apa? Semua calon presiden yang disebutkan ini omdo (omong doang), kata Afriansyah. Mendengar pidato tersebut, Presiden Jokowi yang hadir dalam acara tersebut terlihat hanya tertawa dan menggelengkan kepala.4. Ketua MPR Bambang SoesatyoSebelumnya, Ketua MPR Bambang Soesatyo juga telah mencuatkan isu Jokowi tiga periode. Wacana itu muncul setelah terbitnya hasil survei yang menyebut kepuasan publik atas kinerja presiden masih tinggi. Klaim Bamsoet ini mengutip hasil survei Poltracking yang menyebut 73,2 persen responden puas dengan kinerja pemerintah.Politikus Partai Golkar itu kemudian mempertanyakan apakah kepuasan publik berbanding lurus dengan keinginan agar Jokowi tetap menjabat. Meski begitu, Bamsoet sadar bahwa isu Jokowi tiga periode mendapat banyak pertentangan dari banyak pihak. Namun, dia menyebut ada pula masyarakat yang menginginkan agar Jokowi tetap terus menjabat tiga periode.Terlepas itu, saya sendiri ingin tau keinginan publik yang sesungguhnya ini apa? Apakah kepuasan ini ada korelasinya dengan keinginan masyarakat beliau tetap memimpin kita dalam masa transisi ini, kata Bamsoet.5. Relawan JokowiTeriakan Jokowi 3 periode menggema di acara Nusantara Bersatu di Stadion Gelora Bung Karno, Jakarta Pusat, Sabtu, 26 November 2022. Presiden Jokowi pun menanggapi teriakan dari para relawan yang hadir itu. Jokowi tiga periode, tiga periode, teriak relawan saat Jokowi menyapa dari atas panggung. Teriakan tersebut disambut Jokowi dengan tawa.Dari pantauan Tempo, Jokowi tersenyum dan membentuk angka tiga dengan jarinya merespon teriakan para relawan tersebut. Selain itu, para relawan yang hadir tampak mengenakan baju dengan tulisan 2024 ikut Jokowi. Spanduk kecil yang menyatakan relawan bakal patuh terhadap Jokowi pada Pilpres 2024 juga dibawa oleh relawan.6. Kepala BKPM Bahlil LahadaliaMelansir Antara, Menteri Investasi/Kepala Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal atau BKPM Bahlil Lahadalia juga pernah mengusulkan Jokowi 3 periode dan menunda Pemilu 2024. Bahlil dalam acara rilis temuan survei Indikator Politik Indonesia pada Senin, 10 Januari 2022 menyebut para pelaku usaha di Indonesia ingin agar Pemilu 2024 diundur.

126,tempo,Jokowi Ingin Pindahkan Depo Pertamina dari Pemukiman: Lindungi Obyek Vital,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/05/id_1186254/1186254_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698819/jokowi-ingin-pindahkan-depo-pertamina-dari-pemukiman-lindungi-obyek-vital,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Buffer zone atau kawasan penyangga yang memisahkan Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, dengan pemukiman warga kini menuai sorotan, karena sudah diusulkan sejak 2009 silam. Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi yang pernah menjadi Gubernur DKI Jakarta 2012-2014 mengakui usulan tersebut juga dibahas di era kepemimpinannya.""Dulu memang sudah direncanakan untuk dibuat air di kanan kirinya sungai, tetapi memang belum sampai kepada titik mencarikan solusi kepada penduduknya yang ada di situ,"" kata Jokowi saat ditemui mengunjungi para pengungsi kebakaran Depo Pertamina di RPTRA Rasela, Koja, Jakarta Utara, Minggu, 5 Maret 2023.""Tanah merah-nya ini kan padat dan penuh. Semuanya harus dicarikan solusi. Saya kira keamanan masyarakat, keselamatan masyarakat harus menjadi titik yang utama,"" kata dia. Tanah Merah mengacu pada Jalan Tanah Merah Bawah yang jadi lokasi kebakaran.Jokowi menyebut seharusnya zona ini harusnya menjadi zona air, seperti misalnya dibuat sungai yang memisahkan Depo dan pemukiman. Tujuannya untuk melindungi objek vital yang ada di dalam Depo. ""Karena barang-barang didalamnya barang-barang yang sangat bahaya untuk berdekatan dengan masyarakat, apalagi dengan pemukiman penduduk,"" kata dia.Heru Ungkit Buffer ZoneSebelumnya, kebakaran terjadi di Depo Pertamina pada Jumat malam, pukul 20.11 WIB, 3 Maret 2023. Usulan soal buffer zone ini diungkit Heru saat mengunjungi lokasi kebakaran pada Jumat malam tersebut.Heru menyebut tahun 2009, pemerintah daerah sudah mengusulkan buffer zone selebar 50 meter. Akan tetapi, Heru tak menjelaskan lagi apakah buffer zone ini sudah dibuat, atau hanya dibuat untuk beberapa titik saja.""Kira-kira begitu, kami kembalikan ke Pertamina,"" kata Heru usai menggelar rapat darurat di Pos Koramil Koja, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu dini hari, 4 Maret 2023. Heru pernah jadi Wali Kota Jakarta Utara 2014-2015 di era Gubernur DKI Jokowi, lalu berlanjut ke era Gubernur DKI Basuki Tjahaja Purnama alias Ahok.Sekretaris Daerah DKI Jakarta Joko Agus Setyono mengatakan Pemerintah Provinsi akan berkerja sama dengan Pertamina untuk melanjutkan rencana pembuatan buffer zone di kawasan Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara. ""Kita bikin kerja sama, lah, sama Pertamina,"" kata Joko kepada wartawan di Koramil Rawa Badak Selatan, Jakarta Utara, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Namun, eks Kepala BPK Bali itu belum merinci soal pembuatan buffer zone ini. ""Ya, pastinya, semuanya itu, upaya-upaya untuk mengarah yang lebih bagus,"" ujarnya.Era Fauzi BowoTahun 2019, Jakarta dipimpin oleh Gubernur Fauzi Bowo. Kala itu, Tempo memberitakan bahwa Kawasan Tanah Merah, Plumpang, Jakarta Utara dipastikan akan dibersihkan di tahun tersebut. Wilayah tersebut akan dibangun buffer zone Depo Pertamina Plumpang.""Pemerintah pusat mentargetkan 2009 ini buffer zone selesai dibangun,"" kata Walikota Jakarta Utara, Bambang Sugiyono di ruang kerjanya, akhir pekan lalu.Proses pembangunan dan pembebasan lahan di Tanah Merah, kata Bambang, dilakukan oleh Tim Penataan Depo Plumpang yang duduk sebagai penanggung jawab adalah Gubernur DKI Fauzi Bowo, dan Wakil Gubernur Prijanto sebagai pelaksana. ""Wali Kota mengerjakan inventarisasi, penyuluhan, dan pembebasan,"" kata Bambang.Proses pembangunan zona penyangga tersebut, lanjut Bambang, sudah memasuki tahap inventarisasi dan sosialisasi kepada warga. Ia mengakui tahap ini tergolong sulit, khususnya memverifikasi pemilik lahan sebenarnya. ""Bermacam-macam. Ada yang punya sertifikat tanah, agendum, dan lainnya,"" ujarnya.IMB Anies DisorotSelain buffer zone, masalah status lahan dan bangunan warga pun jadi sorotan. Anggota Fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPRD DKI Jakarta Gilbert Simanjuntak menyatakan sepatutnya mantan Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan ikut bertanggungjawab atas kebakaran Depo Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta Utara, pada Jumat malam lalu.Menurut Gilbert, sejak awal sudah diketahui bahwa lahan di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang tidak boleh ada permukiman dalam jarak tertentu. Lahan yang terkena kebakaran tadi adalah milik PT Pertamina.""Lahan milik PT Pertamina ditempati warga akan tetapi oleh Anies sewaktu menjabat Gubernur diberi IMB, yang jelas bertentangan dengan peraturan,"" ujar Gilbert dalam keterangannya pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Gilbert menilai IMB yang dikeluarkan Anies Baswedan saat menjabat Gubernur DKI membuat persoalan semakin rumit. Menurut dia, saat itu Anies terkesan lebih mementingkan pemenuhan janji kampanye walau harus menabrak aturan. ""Kesalahan itu tidak sepatutnya berulang.""Berkaca dari kejadian tersebut, Gilbert penduduk di sekitar Depo Pertamina Plumpang dipindahkan agar tidak menjadi korban lagi.Gubernur DKI Jakarta Anies Baswedan menerbitkan IMB (Izin Mendirikan Bangunan) Sementara kepada penduduk Kampung Tanah Merah pada Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.""Ini adalah jalan tengah yang kami ambil untuk menyelesaikan masalah bangunan-bangunan yang berada di tanah yang status legalnya belum tuntas. Tapi mereka faktanya ada di tempat ini sudah puluhan tahun,"" kata Anies Baswedan di Kampung Tanah Merah, Sabtu, 16 Oktober 2021.Pertamina enggan berkomentar lebih lanjut ketika ditanya mengenai

""Menjadi catatan penting adalah bahwa jangan sampai hanya menilai soal putusannya tetapi bagaimana majelis hakim ini mengambil langkah putusan. Nah ini harus didalami oleh Komisi Yudisial,"" ujar Ramadhan Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Menurut PSHK, penggalian motif bertujuan untuk mengurangi spekulasi adanya agenda penundaan Pemilu di masyarakat.""Memang perlu dipertanyakan dan juga hal ini perlu diperdalam oleh pihak-pihak termasuk masyarakat sipil ya. Dalam hal ini untuk melihat apakah memang benar sesuai dengan apa yang mereka yakini atau di balik ini memang ada sesuatu yang terjadi,"" katanya.Peneliti Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) Kurnia Ramadhana mengatakan kecurigaan penundaan Pemilu 2024 adalah hal yang wajar karena sebelumnya Menko Marinves Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, hingga Ketua MPR Bambang Soesatyo yang pernah mengungkapkan wacana penundaan Pemilu 2024 ke publik.""Tentu kita masih ingat dan menjadi hal wajar jika masyarakat khawatir menanggapi putusan pengadilan negeri Jakarta pusat karena dua tiga tahun ke belakang banyak sekali politisi yang menggaungkan wacana penundaan pemilu misalnya Menkomarinves Luhut binsar Panjaitan dengan big datanya. Kemudian, Ketua Umum PAN Zulkifli Hasan dan juga Ketua Umum Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa Muhaimin. Lalu ada Bahlil menteri BKPM kemudian baru-baru ini ada Ketua MPR Bambang Susatyo,"" ujarnya.Sebelumnya, Juru Bicara Komisi Yudisal (KY) Miko Ginting menyampaikan pihaknya tengah mendalami putusan Hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat perihal putusanpenundaan Pemilupada persidangan perdata Partai Prima 2 Maret 2023. RencananyaKomisi Yudisialakan memanggil ketiga Hakim PN Jakarta Pusat yaitu T. Oyong, H. Bakri, dan Dominggus Silaban.""Untuk itu, KY akan melakukan pendalaman terhadap putusan itu, terutama untuk melihat apakah ada dugaan pelanggaran perilaku yang terjadi. Salah satu bagian dari pendalaman itu bisa jadi dengan memanggil hakim untuk dimintakan klarifikasi."" ujarnya dalam keterangan tertulis pada 3 Maret 2023.KY juga telah berkomunikasi bersama Mahkamah Agung dalam mencermati substansi putusan yang dibuat oleh para Hakim tersebut""Kami juga akan berkomunikasi dengan Mahkamah Agung terkait dengan putusan ini serta aspek perilaku hakim yang terkait.""ucapnya.Menurutnya, Putusan Pengadilan sudah seharusnya bersandar aspek demokratis, aspek aspirasi masyarakat secara sosiologis dan patuh pada Undang-Undang Dasar 1945.""Putusan pengadilan tidak bekerja di ruang hampa karena ada aspirasi yang hidup di masyarakat secara sosiologis, ada aspek yuridis di mana kepatuhan terhadap UUD 1945 dan undang-undang sangatlah penting, serta pertimbangan-pertimbangan lain, seperti nilai-nilai demokrasi."" ujarnya.Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusatmemerintahkan Komisi Pemilihan Umum untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Perintah tersebut tertuang dalam putusan perdata yang diajukanPartai Primadengan tergugat Komisi Pemilihan Umum.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Putusan tersebut dibacakan oleh Majelis Hakim pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.

Partai Prima mengajukan gugatan setelah dinyatakan tidak lolos dalam verifikasi administrasi untuk menjadi Pemilu 2024.Dalam putusannya, PN Jakarta Pusatmerintahkan KPU untuk menghentikan tahapan pemilu yang telah berjalan. Majelis hakim juga memerintahkan KPU untuk mengulang seluruh tahapan pemilu sejak awal.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Selain menunda pemilu, hakim juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta. Pengadilan juga menyatakan bahwa penggugat, yakni Partai Prima adalah partai politik yang dirugikan dalam verifikasi administrasi.Putusan tersebut dianggap cacat hukum dan menyalahi konstitusi.

Komisioner Komnas HAM Hari Kurniawan mengatakan tim tersebut independen dengan tidak ada unsur dari TNI dan Polri.""Tim investigasi Komnas HAM ini tidak melibatkan TNI-Polri karena mereka sebagai pihak yang diperiksa Komnas HAM konteks peristiwa Wamena,"" ujar dia pada Jum'at 3 Maret 2023.Ihwal perkembangan investigasi, Hari mengatakan tim independen Komnas HAM masih mengembangkan fakta-fakta di lapangan. Menurutnya tim baru mendapatkan temuan awal.""Hasil investigasi awal memang ada isu penculikan anak. Ini kan belum sedetail itu. Baru ada informasi bahwa pelaku sudah diamankan oleh polisi,"" kata Hari saat ditemui di Kantor Komnas HAM, Jakarta.Hari berujar tim Komnas HAM belum menemukan indikasi penculikan. Namun, kata dia, tim sudah menemukan indikasi kekerasan aparat terhadap masyarakat sipil. ""Kesimpulan awal, ya. Tapi teman-teman di Wamena masih terus bekerja di sana,"" ujar dia.Hari membenarkan ada dugaan kekerasan yang dilakukan aparat. Meski begitu, kata dia, masih terlalu dini untuk menyimpulkan hal tersebut. ""Ada dugaan aparat terlibat di situ, tapi saya belum berani berbicara detail. Sebab masih dilakukan investigasi,"" kata Hari.Mengenai dugaan adanya penembakan oleh aparat, Hari mengatakan hingga saat ini tim yang dikirim masih belum menemukannya.""Belum, kalau Komnas HAM belum menemukannya. Makanya tadi dibilang untuk memperdalam investigasi pekan depan untuk turunkan tim ke Wamena,"" kata Hari.Dipicu Isu Penculikan AnakKekerasan di Wamena, Papua, 23 Februari 2023 bermula dari rumor penculikan anak oleh dua orang pedagang. Massa mengamuk setelah melihat dua orang penjual kelontong menggunakan mobil dan menuduh mereka sebagai penculik. Massa yang marah kemudian terprovokasi meski tokoh masyarakat berupaya menenangkannya. Massa tetap menyerang aparat. Pasca kejadian tersebut, sejumlah mahasiswa Papua mengadakan aksi di depan Kantor Komnas HAM pada 3 Maret 2023 lalu. Aksi tersebut dilakukan untuk mendesak Komnas HAM menerjunkan tim untuk menyelidiki kasus tersebut.""Itu kami mau nuntut melaporkan peristiwa di Wamena dan kami follow up peristiwa sebelumnya kami

Terbaru, Pengadilan Negeri atau PN Jakarta Pusat mengetok palu Pemilu 2024 ditunda hingga 2025. Keputusan tersebut tertuang dalam putusan perdata yang diajukan Partai Prima dengan tergugat Komisi Pemilihan Umum.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Vonis Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat itu menambah daftar pewacana penundaan Pemilu 2024. Berikut sejumlah pihak yang pernah menggaungkan agar Pemilu ditunda.Ketua Umum Golkar Airlangga Hartarto (tengah), Ketua Umum PAN Zulkifli Hasan (kiri) dan Plt Ketua Umum PPP Mardiono, melakukan pertemuan di Restoran Bunga Rampai, Jakarta, Rabu, 30 November 2022.

PLt Ketum PPP Muhammad MardionoWacana penundaan pemilu 2024 kembali bergulir pada awal Februari lalu. Usulan itu diembuskan lagi oleh pelaksana tugas Ketua Umum Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (PPP) Muhammad Mardiono. Sosok yang juga menjabat sebagai Utusan Khusus Presiden Bidang Kerja Sama Pengentasan Kemiskinan dan Ketahanan Pangan itu awalnya menilai masyarakat tidak terlalu antusias menyambut Pemilu 2024. Dia juga mengaku sempat berkeliling ke-30 provinsi dan melihat masyarakat lebih peduli pada pemulihan ekonomi ketimbang Pemilu.Antusiasme masyarakat menanggapi pemilu itu saya lihat tidak begitu respon tinggi, tetapi agak dingin, ujarnya saat dihubungi, Sabtu, 4 Februari 2023.Mardiono mengingatkan, Indonesia termasuk negara yang masih pada tahap recovery dari trauma pandemi Covid-19. Sehingga, menurutnya, pelaksanaan tahun politik jangan sampai merusak pemulihan masyarakat dari trauma usai hadapi dua tahun belakangan akibat Covid-19. Jangan sampai tahun politik ini mengganggu pada situasi masyarakat atau rakyat yang masih trauma itu, ujarnya.2. Ketum Partai Golkar Airlangga HartartoKetum Partai Golkar Airlangga Hartarto merupakan salah satu pihak yang mendukung wacana Cak Imin. Bahkan pihaknya mengatakan wacana penundaan Pemilu 2024 tersebut merupakan aspirasi dari masyarakat. Hal ini disampaikan Airlangga seusai bertemu Ketua Umum Partai NasDem Surya Paloh di NasDem Tower, Jakarta, Kamis, 10 Maret 2022.Kita musti mengerti yang namanya aspirasi itu tidak boleh ditolak, apalagi kita suara Golkar suara rakyat, tutur Airlangga.Lagi pula, kata Airlangga, Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi menyatakan bahwa aspirasi demokratis tetap harus dipegang teguh. Terlebih tantangan permasalahan yang dihadapi Indonesia ke depan makin berat.3. Ketum PAN Zulkifli HasanKetum Partai Amanat Nasional ata7 PAN, Zulkifli Hasan, juga pernah menyatakan dukungan atas usulan penundaan Pemilu 2024 oleh Cak Imin. Menurut sosok yang akrab dipanggil Zulhas itu, terdapat sejumlah alasan dirinya mendukung usulan tersebut. Antara lain soal angka kepuasan terhadap pemerintahan Jokowi.Berbagai survei menyebut angkanya (kepuasan terhadap Jokowi) di atas 73 persen, ujar Zulhas di Gedung Parlemen, Jumat, 28 Januari 2022.Jokowi masih harus menjabat setelah 2024, menurut Hasan karena pertama situasi pandemi yang masih berlangsung dan memerlukan perhatian khusus. Lalu kondisi perekonomian yang belum stabil, sehingga pemerintah, dunia usaha, maupun masyarakat masih perlu melakukan pemulihan. Perkembangan situasi konflik global yang perlu diantisipasi, di antaranya perang Rusia-Ukraina dan tidak menentunya harga minyak dunia.Lalu anggaran Pemilu yang justru membengkak dari rencana efisiensi, sehingga lebih baik dikonsentrasikan untuk kepentingan kesejahteraan rakyat. Terakhir, keberlangsungan program-program pembangunan nasional yang sebelumnya tertunda akibat pandemi. Mempertimbangkan hal-hal tersebut, serta setelah mendengar masukan dan aspirasi dari berbagai kalangan, PAN setuju bahwa pemilu perlu dipertimbangkan untuk diundur, kata Zulhas.Wakil Ketua DPR RI Abdul Muhaimin Iskandar.

Wakil Ketua DPR RI itu mengusulkan agar Pemilu 2024 ditunda selama satu atau dua tahun. Saya mengusulkan Pemilu 2024 ditunda satu atau dua tahun. Usulan ini nanti akan saya sampaikan ke pimpinan-pimpinan partai dan presiden, ujar Muhaimin lewat keterangan tertulis, Rabu, 23 Februari 2022.Menurut Muhaimin, wacana itu terlintas olehnya usai bersua dengan pelaku usaha mikro, pengusaha dan para analis ekonomi dari berbagai perbankan di Ruang Delegasi DPR, Nusantara III, Jakarta, Rabu, 23 Februari 2022. Mereka memprediksi Indonesia akan mengalami momentum perbaikan ekonomi usai dua tahun pandemi Covid-19. Menurut Muhaimin, momentum ini tak boleh terganggu dengan adanya pesta politik.Menteri Koordinator Bidang Kemaritiman dan Investasi Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.

Nah, inilah yang mau kita zoning ulang, tata ulang, tidak hanya di Pertamina, termasuk PLN, termasuk pupuk,"" kata Erick.Dengan adanya zoning wilayah aman antara pemukiman warga dan objek vital, diharapkan masyarakat bisa lebih aman.

Idham Holik menyatakan bahwa KPU menolak putusan PN Jakpus.""KPU RI akan banding atas putusan PN tersebut. KPU tegas menolak putusan PN tersebut dan ajukan banding, kata Idham pada Kamis lalu.Pasal 431 UU Pemilu menyatakan bahwa pemilu lanjutan digelar sebagian atau di seluruh wilayah Indonesia jika terjadi kerusuhan, gangguan keamanan, bencana alam, atau gangguan lainnya yang mengakibatkan sebagian tahapan penyelenggaraaan pemilu tidak dapat dilaksanakan. Pelaksanaan pemilu lanjutan dimulai dari tahap yang terhenti.Adapun Pasal 432 menjelaskan jika kejadian dalam pasal 431 mengakibatkan seluruh tahapan penyelenggaraan pemilu tidak dapat dilaksanakan, maka dilakukan pemilu susulan.

Oyong, dengan hakim anggota H. Bakri dan Dominggus Silaban.Dalam putusannya, majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum. Adapun perbuatan melawan hukum yang dimaksud adalah KPU menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi partai politik calon peserta pemilu.Selain penundaan, pengadilan juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta.

Sebab, menurut dia, pertemuan dua pihak itu bisa merusak hubungan yang terjalin antara pemerintah Indonesia dengan Fiji.""Kontak antara Rabuka dengan Wenda ini bisa merusak hubungan bilateral Fiji-Indonesia yang berdasarkan prinsip saling menghargai kedaulatan dan keutuhan wilayah,"" kata pengajar Universitas Padjadjaran tersebut pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Reza mengatakan dalam jangka pendek, pertemuan antara Sitivani Rabuka dan Benny Wenda bisa menguntungkan gerakan separatis Papua. Sebab, hal tersebut bisa menjadi simbol dukungan sehingga bisa menguatkan posisi Benny Wenda.""Dimana Wenda akan mendapat dukungan dari kalangan Melanesia di Pasifik Selatan, yakni pemerintah, kalangan dunia usaha, agama, dan masyarakat umum,"" kata dia melalui pesan tertulis saat dihubungi Tempo.Namun, Reza menyebut komunikasi Rabuka-Wenda berpotensi berakibat buruk terhadap hubungan bilateral antara RI dengan Fiji ke depan karena bisa memancing respon negatif dari masyarakat. ""Serta membuat gundah masyarakat masyarakat di dalam negeri Indonesia, khususnya di Indonesia bagian Timur,"" ujar Reza.Selain itu, Reza mengatakan pertemuan antara Wenda-Rabuka bisa merugikan kondisi sosio-politik masyarakat Indonesia. Ia menilai hal tersebut bisa menjadi angin segar pihak tertentu melancarkan aksi tidak baik mereka. ""Akan terdapat kalangan tertentu yang mengambil manfaat dari pertemuan tersebut, dan menafsirkannya secara berlebihan,"" tutur dia.Reza mengatakan pertemuan tersebut bisa jadi ujian bagi pemerintah Indonesia. Ia menyebut pemerintah harus bisa menekan semua potensi gejolak yang mungkin bisa terjadi.""Namun gejolak di Papua dapat dihindari. Sekiranya pemerintah Indonesia dapat membuktikan sudah terjadinya integrasi budaya dalam masyarakat Indonesia di Provinsi Papua dan Provinsi Papua Barat, di mana semuanya hidup damai sebagai penduduk Indonesia,"" kata Reza.Indonesia Kecewa pada FijiSebelumnya, Pemimpin Persatuan Gerakan Pembebasan Papua Barat (ULMWP) Benny Wenda membagikan foto pertemuannya dengan Perdana Menteri Fiji Sitivani Rabuka. Hal tersebut diunggah oleh Wenda melalui akun Twitter resminya,""Suatu kehormatan untuk bertemu dengan Anda berdua dan mendiskusikan masa depan Melanesia dan Pasifik yang lebih luas,"" kata Benny Wenda dalam cuitannya.Menanggapi hal itu, Pemerintah RI sempat menyatakan rasa keberatannya. Juru Bicara Kementerian Luar Negeri RI Teuku Faizasyah mengatakan pemerintah telah menyampaikan nota diplomatik kepada Pemerintah Fiji pada 2 Maret 2023 lalu.""Kurang lebihnya dalan nota tersebut

Pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023 lalu, Majelis Hakim yang diketuai Hakim Oyong atau Tengku Oyong memutuskan Komisi Pemilihan Umum menunda Pemilu. Vonis itu buntut dari gugatan Partai Prima yang tak terima gagal jadi peserta Pemilu 2024.Majelis Hakim menyebut KPU telah melakukan tindakan melawan hukum. Pasalnya, KPU menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi partai politik. Karena itu, PN Jakarta Pusat menghukum KPU untuk tak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024. Jeda itu berlangsung selama dua tahun, empat bulan atau hingga 2025. Arinya, bisa mengakibatkan Pemilu 2024 ditunda.Hakim Oyong merupakan hakim madya utama dengan pangkat pembina utama muda (IV/C) di PN Jakarta Pusat. Dia dimutasi ke PN Jakarta Pusat setelah sebelumnya bertugas di PN Medan. Dirangkum dari berbagai sumber, T Oyong tercatat pernah menangani sejumlah perkara. Berikut kasus-kasus yang pernah ditangani T Oyong.1. Kasus Gugatan Fadel Muhammad kepada La Nyalla dan MahyudinSaat bertugas di PN Jakpus, T Oyong pernah menangani gugatan yang dilayangkan anggota DPD RI Fadel Muhammad. Gugatan tersebut ditujukan kepada tergugat I Ketua DPD La Nyalla Mahmud Mattalitti, dan tergugat II Ketua DPD RI Mahyudin. Fadel menggugat keduanya lantaran dicopot dari jabatannya sebagai Wakil Ketua MPR dari unsur DPD. Ketika itu, gugatan Fadel ditolak. PN Jakarta Pusat menyatakan tidak berwenang mengadili Surat Keputusan DPD RI atas hasil Sidang Paripurna Lembaga Negara tersebut.2. Kasus penipuan Eks Calon Dirut Bank Sumut Freddy HutabaratT Oyong juga pernah menangani perkara kasus mantan calon Direktur Utama atau Dirut PT Bank Sumut Freddy Hutabarat. Freddy terbukti melakukan penipuan sebesar Rp 275 juta terhadap seorang pengusaha bernama Ali Sutomo. T Oyong memvonis Freddy pidana penjara selama 2 bulan dengan masa percobaan 4 bulan. Namun sidang putusan dinilai ganjal. Pasalnya, T Oyong terkesan buru-buru dalam membacakan vonis mantan Manager klub bola, PSMS Medan itu. Bahkan bacaan putusan tersebut hanya berlangsung 3 menit.Menjatuhkan hukuman pidana penjara kepada terdakwa Freddy Hutabarat selama 2 bulan penjara dengan masa percobaan 4 bulan, kata Tengku Oyong dengan nada pelan.3. Kasus pembunuhan oleh Edy SuwantoPada 2021 lalu, T Oyong tercatat sebagai hakim yang menangani kasus pembunuhan dan penculikan oleh Edy Suwanto Sukandi atau Ko Ahwat Tango. Edy menjadi terdakwa atas penculikan dan pembunuhan terhadap pengusaha rental mobil Jefri Wijaya alias Asiong. Namun, T Oyong hanya menghukum Edy dengan pidana 5 bulan dan 3 hari penjara. Padahal, kasus tersebut merupakan kasus yang sangat berat dan berlapis, yakni pasal pembunuhan berencana sekaligus pasal perampasan kemerdekaan.4. Kasus Nyi Roro KidulHakim Oyong juga pernah menangani kasus seorang perempuan bernama Siska Sari W Maulidhina alias Siska yang mengaku keturunan Nyi Roro Kidul. Siska dituding melakukan penipuan terhadap anggota DPR RI Rudi Hartono Bangun berkedok titisan makhluk mitologis itu. Akibatnya, Rudi yang juga mantan kekasih Siska, merugi hingga Rp 4 miliar. Namun T Oyong memvonis lepas Nyi Roro Kidul palsu itu dari segala tuntutan.Padahal Jaksa menganggap Siska terbukti melakukan hal sebagaimana dakwaan jaksa penuntut umum (JPU) melanggar Pasal 378 Jo Pasal 55 ayat (1) ke 1 KUHP serta pencucian uang sebagaimana diatur dan diancam pidana dalam Pasal 3 UU RI No. 8 Tahun 2010. Jaksa menuntut Siska dengan pidana penjara 10 tahun dan denda Rp 2 miliar subsider enam bulan kurungan. Tapi Hakim Oyong menyebut tindakan Siska tidak termasuk ke dalam perbuatan pidana.5. Kasus perobek dan pembuang Al-Quran Doni Irawan MalayHakim Oyong pernah pula menangani kasus perobek dan pembuang Al-Quran Masjid Raya Al-Mashun Kota Medan, Doni Irawan Malay. Dalam kasus tersebut, T Oyong menjatuhkan vonis hukuman pidana selama tiga tahun penjara kepada Doni. Terdakwa terbukti bersalah dengan sengaja mengeluarkan perasaan atau melakukan perbuatan bersifat permusuhan, dan penodaan terhadap suatu agama yang dianut di Indonesia.

97,tempo,Perludem Dukung Banding KPU atas Putusan Penundaan Pemilu PN Jakarta Pusat,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2019/04/23/id_836436/836436_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698620/perludem-dukung-banding-kpu-atas-putusan-penundaan-pemilu-pn-jakarta-pusat,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Perkumpulan Pemilu untuk Demokrasi (Perludem) mendukung niat Komisi Pemilihan Umum atau KPU yang menyatakan banding terhadap putusan penundaan pemilu. Direktur Eksekutif Perludem Khoirunnisa Agustyati mengatakan hal itu menegaskan sikap KPU yang ingin pemilu 2024 tetap berjalan sebagaimana mestinya.Khoirunnisa menuturkan sejatinya putusan tersebut tidak bisa dijalankan oleh KPU. Sebab, menurut dia, putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut melanggar konstitusi.""Putusan ini kalau menurut saya tidak bisa dieksekusi karena tidak sesuai dengan konstitusi dan skema penegakan hukum pemilu kita,"" kata Khoirunnisa pada Sabtu 4 Maret 2023.Meski begitu, Khoirunnisa menilai KPU harus tetap mengajukan banding ke Pengadilan Tinggi. Ia mengatakan hal tersebut bisa jadi penegasan KPU menolak wacana perpanjangan masa jabatan pemerintah.""Tapi secara prosedur KPU bisa saja melakukan banding. Ini juga untuk menegaskan kepada publik bahwa KPU siap menyelenggarakan pemilu sesuai dengan jadwal,"" kata dia melalui pesan tertulis kepada Tempo.Selain itu, Khoirunnisa merasa ada kejanggalan dari Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat yang menerima pengajuan gugatan Partai Prima atas KPU. Sebab, ia menilai tidak ada kewenangan bagi Pengadilan Negeri menangani kasus sengketa pemilu. ""Kalau baca dari putusan ini keputusan KPU yang menyatakan bahwa Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat adalah perbuatan melawan hukum. Bisa juga karena hakim yang memeriksa ini tidak memiliki perspektif pemilu yang komperhesif. Karena memang bukan kompentensinya PN untuk menangani perkara soal pemilu,"" ujar dia.Khoirunnisa juga menyebut majelis hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat juga gagal memahami hukum di Indonesia. Sebab, kata dia, pelaksanaan pemilu tahun 2024 merupakan amanat dari UUD 1945.""Dalam pasal tertentu di UU Pemilu memang ada hal tertentu yang membolehkan pemilu ditunda. Namun, hal itu dibatasi oleh kondisi yang genting seperti bencana alam dan juga dilakukan di daerah yang terdampak saja bukan seluruh daerah,"" kata Khoirunnisa.Putusan PN Jakpus Bisa Menjadi Preseden BurukOleh ssebab itu, Khoirunnisa menilai putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat bisa menimbulkan preseden buruk ke depan. Sebab, menurut dia, bisa jadi orang-orang menganggap masalah sengketa pemilu sebagai ranah perdata dan bukan administrasi negara. ""Kalau ini dinormalisasi bisa jadi nanti ada orang kalah pemilu akan menuntut ganti rugi ke KPU. Padahal skema ini tidak ada,"" kata dia. Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat sebelumnya mengabulkan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU karena merasa dirugikan karena tidak lolos hasil administrasi Pemilu. ""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Sementara itu, KPU akan menempuh upaya hukum banding terhadap putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut.

Wakil Ketua MPR RI, Lestari Moerdijat, mengatakan, berbagai pusat pertumbuhan ekonomi di kawasan timur Indonesia harus terus direalisasikan.""Sektor pariwisata sebagai salah satu sektor yang potensial di kawasan itu diharapkan mampu menjadi akselerator pemerataan pembangunan,"" kata Lestari, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Pada ajang East Indonesia Investment Summit 2023 di Makassar, Sulawesi Selatan (Sulsel), Jumat, 3 Maret 2023, Menteri Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif Sandiaga Uno menargetkan investasi US$ 100 juta dari sektor pariwisata di kawasan timur Indonesia. Target itu berpotensi menciptakan 4,4 juta lapangan kerja baru.Sejumlah destinasi wisata super prioritas ada di Indonesia timur. Destinasi itu antara lain Likupang (Sulawesi Utara), Mandalika (NTB), dan Labuan Bajo (NTT).Menurut Lestari, dorongan untuk meningkatkan investasi di kawasan timur Indonesia selain untuk mengejar target sektor pariwisata nasional sekaligus untuk merealisasikan pemerataan pembangunan di tanah air.Apalagi, Rerie sapaan akrab Lestari melanjutkan, tren peningkatan aktivitas pariwisata mulai dirasakan. Catatan Kemenparekraf per Januari 2022 terdapat pertumbuhan perjalanan wisata global ke Indonesia sebesar 152 persen jika dibandingkan dengan capaian Januari 2021.Pada 2022 Jumlah wisatawan mancanegara yang datang ke Indonesia mencapai 5,47 juta orang dan tahun 2023 ditargetkan mampu mencapai 7,4 juta orang. Rerie yang juga anggota Komisi X DPR RI dari Dapil II Jawa Tengah itu, sangat berharap sejumlah target itu dapat dicapai lewat penguatan kolaborasi para pemangku kepentingan dari tingkat pusat hingga daerah serta masyarakat.Selain itu dukungan pihak swasta, menurut Anggota Majelis Tinggi Partai NasDem ini, juga sangat diperlukan dalam rangka memperkuat sektor pendukung seperti sarana transpotasi dan akomodasi.

""Kita tidak diam, kita harus berjuang,"" kata dia semangatHasto pun mengharapakan kalau saat ini, mekanisme demokrasi tahunan atau pemilu dapat terus dijalankan dengan tepat waktu. ""Pada tanggal 14 Februari 2024,"" ucap dia.Hasto Bilang Ada Manuver Besar Hasto mensinyalir ada manuver besar di balik putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soal penundaan Pemilu 2024. Hasto menilai putusan tersebut melawan amanat konstitusi. ""Ada sesuatu kekuatan besar di balik peristiwa pengadilan PN Jakarta Pusat tersebut yang mencoba untuk menunda Pemilu 2024,"" kata Hasto. Menurut Hasto kekuatan besar itu mencoba memanfaatkan celah hukum sebagai upaya melakukan penundaan pemilu. ""Melakukan suatu gerak yang pada dasarnya inkonstitusional untuk menunda pemilu,"" ujar Hasto.Padahal, kata Hasto, Undang-Undangan Nomor 7 tahun 2017 tentang Pemilu telah jelas mengatur sengketa yang berkaitan dengan partai politik dan peserta pemilu hanya dilakukan oleh Bawaslu dan Pengadilan Tinggi Usaha Negara (PTUN). ""Karena Komisioner KPU adalah pejabat tata usaha negara,"" ucap Hasto.Sebelumnya, Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan KPU untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Putusan tersebut disampaikan pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan.Majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum.

Ia mengharapkan mekanisme demokrasi tahunan atau pemilu dapat terus dijalankan dengan tepat waktu. Hasto juga menyinyalir ada manuver besar di balik putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat soal penundaan Pemilu 2024. Putusan tersebut dinilai cacat hukum karena melampaui yuridiksi.

Menurut Ade, keputusan Hakim itu merupakan hasil dari gugatan Partai Prima yang seharusnya dihormati.""Itu kan hak hukum yang harus kita hormati. Lembaga peradilan ini harus kita hormati, saya hanya mengajak ketika ada orang berperkara masalah hukum, kenapa kita harus protes pada hasilnya? Kita jangan terlalu naif, kita harus hormati,"" ujar Ade dalam diskusi virtual, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Menurut Ade vonis majelis hakim pasti tak mungkin muncul secara tiba-tiba. Ia mengatakan pasti ada proses di pengadilan mulai dari pembacaan tuntutan, eksepsi, hingga bantahan dari kedua belah pihak yang berperkara. Semua proses tersebut, menurut Ade, luput dari pengawasan masyarakat.""Kita enggak tahu, kita tahunya di ujung aja. Ada putusan proses peradilan. Saya yakin semua di sini enggak mendengar tahapan persidangan yang ada di Pengadilan Negeri,"" kata Ade.Meski begitu, Ade menegaskan pihaknya tidak membela siapaun di perkara ini. Ia mengaku hanya ingin semua pihak menghormati proses hukum yang berjalan.""Kita harus hormati, saya bukan dalam konteks membela. Yang namanya hakim adalah wakil Tuhan, kalau kita marah-marah berarti kita marahi Tuhan. Kita harus hormati, terlepas dari nanti kekeliruan ada ini itu, ada forumnya lagi,"" kata Ade.PN Jakarta Pusat Perintahkan Tunda Pemilu 2024Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan Komisi Pemilihan Umum untuk menunda Pemilu 2024.

Kami tidak ada bantuan karena yang ada hanya gagasan,"" kata Syahrul saat membuka rapat kerja nasional RPNN di komplek Pusat Pelatihan Manajemen Kepemimpinan (PPMK) Ciawi, Bogor, Jawa Barat, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Syahrul menjelaskan, Kredit Usaha Rakyat adalah program yang dicanangkan Presiden Jokowi dalam membantu petani mendapatkan akses perkreditan. Program ini menjangkau semua petani dari berbagai kalangan di seluruh Indonesia.Terutama kalangan petani milenial yang memiliki kemampuan dalam mengunakan teknologi digitalisasi. ""Saya katakan salah satu fasilitas yang diberikan Bapak Presiden itu adalah kredit usaha rakyat. Tentu aksesnya dengan pengawalan yang sangat ketat dan rasanya ini sangat berarti bagi teman-teman petani di seluruh Indonesia,"" ujarnya.Menurut Syahrul, pertanian adalah sektor yang sangat menjanjikan bagi semua kalangan yang mau berusaha dan bekerja keras. Pertanian juga menjadi sektor yang paling rentan terhadap gangguan dan krisis ekonomi.Dengan kata lain, Syahrul melanjutkan, pertanian memastikan rakyat tidak jatuh pada lubang kemiskinan. ""Kalau Bapak urus pertanian dengan baik pasti tidak miskin. Saya kira inilah saatnya kita membela bangsa dan negara. Posisi Kementan dengan RPNN harus menjadi yang dituju rakyat. Percayalah pertanian itu kokoh dan kuat,"" kata Syahrul.Ketua RPNN, Slamet, mengatakan organisasinya terdiri dari berbagai kalangan yang memiliki misi sama yaitu mewujudkan petani nelayan sejahtera. Slamet mengaku siap mendukung kesuksesan program yang dijalankan pemerintah.""Pertama kami siap melakukan pemberdayaan dan kedua kami siap bergerak bersama memperbaiki nasib petani agar tidak terpinggirkan.

Sekretaris Jenderal PSI Dea Tunggaesti mengatakan gugatan dan putusan penundaan pemilu tersebut salah alamat.PN Jakarta Pusat tidak berwenang untuk memerintahkan penundaan pemilu karena itu memang wewenang khusus yang hanya dimiliki oleh KPU dengan alasan tertentu seperti kejadian bencana alam, kata Dea pada Sabtu 4 Maret 2023.Oleh sebab itu, Dea menyebut PSI akan membela KPU banding hingga ke tingkat kasasi. Sebab, menurut dia, putusan majelis hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut bisa jadi preseden buruk demokrasi Indonesia ke depan.Keputusan ini menjadi contoh buruk bagaimana hakim bisa salah dalam memahami peraturan perundangan. Karena itu kita mendukung upaya KPU untuk banding,"" ujarnya melalui keterangan tertulis.Selain itu, Dea juga menyebut seharusnya Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta sedari awal menolak pengajuan gugatan Partai Prima. Sebab, ia mengatakan gugatan tersebut bukan merupakan ranah Pengadilan Negeri untuk mengadili.Dalam sengketa proses Pemilu yang berwenang adalah Badan Pengawas Pemilu dan Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara (PTUN). Jadi jelas bahwa gugatan dan putusan ini salah alamat, kata Dea.Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat sebelumnya mengabulkan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU karena merasa dirugikan karena tidak lolos hasil administrasi Pemilu. ""Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilu 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Sementara itu, KPU akan menempuh upaya hukum banding terhadap putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat tersebut. Komisioner KPU Idham Holik menyatakan dengan tegas pihaknya menolak putusan PN Jakpus.KPU RI akan banding atas putusan PN Jakarta Pusat tersebut.

Deputi Pencegahan dan Monitoring KPK Pahala Nainggolan mengatakan pihaknya akan fokus terlebih dahulu mencari tindak pidana korupsinya terlebih dahulu.Meski begitu, Pahala mengtakan KPK tetap akan memperhatikan laporan yang dikeluarkan oleh Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi (PPATK) tersebut. Ia mengatakan KPK akan berkoordinasi dengan PPATK mengenai informasi tersebut.Belum, ini mau mencari pidana korupsinya terlebih dahulu baru ditambahkan dengan tindak pidana pencucian uang (TPPU). Ini KPK sedang fokus ke penerimaan gratifikasi atau suap, kata Pahala melalui pesan tertulis pada Ahad, 5 Maret 2023.Selain itu, Pahala mengatakan KPK tidak bisa menindak apabila TPPU yang dilakukan oleh Rafael bukan berasal dari tindak pidana korupsi atau suap dan gratifikasi. Sebab, kata dia, kewenangan KPK terbatas kepada penindakan tindak pidana korupsi serta suap dan gratifikasi.Ya tidak lah. TPPU hasil kejahatan yang dicuci. Kejahatannya bisa narkoba, judi, dan lain sebagainya. KPK mengurus kalo kejahatannya korupsi, dari situ TPPU bisa ditindak oleh KPK, ujar dia melalui pesan tertulis.Selanjutnya, PPATK sebut keterlibatan jasa pencucian uang profesionalSebelumnya, PPATK menyebut ada dugaan Rafael Alun menggunakan jasa jaringan pencucian uang profesional dalam aktivitas transaksinya. Ketua PPATK, Ivan Yustiavandana, menyebut oleh sebab itu PPATK memblokir rekening seorang konsultan pajak dan beberapa pihak lain yang diduga ikut terlibat.""Kita mensinyalir adanya peran profesional money launderer yang selama ini berperan untuk RAT,"" ujar dia dalam keterangan pada Jum'at 3 Maret 2023.Meski begitu, Ivan enggan menjelaskan siapa saja pihak terkait yang diblokir, termasuk konsultan pajak tersebut. Ia juga belum menyebutkan berapa total nilai transaksi yang menjadi dugaan PPATK sebagai tindak pidana pencucian uang tersebut.""Signifikan, berkembang terus. Jumlahnya belum bisa disampaikan,"" ujar Ivan.Harta Rafael Alun disorot setelah kasus putranya mencuatHarta kekayaan Rafael Alun Trisambodo menjadi sorotan publik setelah kasus penganiayaan yang dilakukan anaknya, Mario Dandy Satriyo, mencuat. Mario menganiaya seorang anak berusia 17 tahun berinisial D hingga mengalami koma. Mario saat ini telah mendekam di dalam tahanan Polres Jakarta Selatan.Mario disebut kerap memamerkan harga kekayaan orang tuanya di media sosial. Diantaranya adalah mobil Jeep Rubicon dan motor gede Harley Davidson.Belakangan, Rafael menyatakan bahwa Jeep dan Harley yang dipamerkan Mario itu bukan miliknya. Mobil Jeep Rubicon tersebut juga diketahui atas nama seorang office boy di unit Inafis (Indonesia Automatic Fingerprint Identification System) Polri.PPATK kemudian menyatakan telah menemukan transaksi tak wajar dalam rekening Rafael Alun. Temuan itu bahkan disebut sudah dilaporkan ke aparat penegak hukum sejak 2012.Berdasarkan dokumen Laporan Harta Kekakayaan Penyelenggara Negara (LHKPN) KPK, Rafael memiliki harta berjumlah Rp 56 miliar. Hartanya itu paling banyak berupa properti yang nilainya ditaksir mencapai Rp 51 miliar.KPK menilai jumlah harta yang dimiliki Rafael mencurigakan. Sebab, sebagai pejabat Eselon III di lingkungan Direktorat Jenderal Pajak jumlah harta itu tidak sesuai dengan profil gajinya.KPK telah melakukan pemeriksaan terhadap Rafael Alun Trisambodo pada Rabu lalu, 1 Maret 2023.

Hal itu membuat budaya korupsi di Indonesia masih tinggi.Peneliti Pusat Kajian Antikorupsi Zaenur Rahman menyebut seharusnya penambahan harta kekayaan pejabat secara tidak wajar bisa menjadi peringatan adanya dugaan korupsi. Namun, kata dia, saat ini illicit enrichment masih dibiarkan terjadi di tengah pejabat Indonesia.Kalau dalam konsep tindak pidana korupsi penambahan secara tidak wajar itu kan illicit enrichment. Sampai sekarang illicit enrichment bukan merupakan pelanggaran hukum, kata Zaenur pada Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Oleh sebab itu, Zaenur menilai lemahnya pengawasan terhadap illicit enrichment memunculkan fenomena gaya hidup bermewah-mewahan para pejabat negara dan keluarganya. Padahal, kata dia, hal tersebut memicu seorang pejabat untuk melakukan pidana korupsi.Gaya hidup yang bermewah-mewah akan memunculkan kehausan validasi dari orang lain. Sehingga, gaya hidup tersebut memang menjadi salah satu faktor pendorong korupsi, ujarnya melalui keterangannya.Suara senada juga disampaikan oleh mantan Komisioner Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK) Laode Muhammad Syarif. Ia menilai lemahnya pengawasan dan pencegahan korupsi para pejabat negara adalah karena hukum di Indonesia belum ada yang mengakomodasi illicit enrichment dan unexplained wealth.""Keduanya belum dianggap sebagai kejahatan. Jadi sulit merampas aset penjahat. Karena sampai sekarang belum ada Undang-undang Perampasan Aset,"" ujar Direktur Eksekutif Kemitraan tersebut pada kepada Tempo via pesan tertulis pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.KPK akui sulit melakukan penindakan terhadap pejabat yang memiliki kekayaan tak wajarKPK sempat mengakui masih kesulitan melakukan penindakan terhadap pejabat yang memiliki kekayaan tidak wajar. Wakil Ketua KPK Nawawi Pomolango menyebut Komisi terhambat karena belum adanya regulasi yang mengakomodasi penindakan terhadap kekayaan tidak wajar para pejabat negara.Sebenarnya itu wajib untuk diadopsi, kata Nawawi pada Kamis 2 Februari 2023 di kantornya, Gedung Merah Putih KPK. Jakarta.Harta Rafael Alun disorot setelah kasus putranya mencuatHarta kekayaan Rafael Alun Trisambodo menjadi sorotan publik setelah kasus penganiayaan yang dilakukan anaknya,Mario Dandy Satriyo, mencuat. Mario menganiaya seorang anak berusia 17 tahun berinisial D hingga mengalami koma. Mario saat ini telah mendekam di dalam tahanan Polres Jakarta Selatan.Mario disebut kerap memamerkan harga kekayaan orang tuanya di media sosial. Diantaranya adalah mobil Jeep Rubicon dan motor gede Harley Davidson.Belakangan, Rafael menyatakan bahwa Jeep dan Harley yang dipamerkan Mario itu bukan miliknya. Mobil Jeep Rubicon tersebut juga diketahui atas nama seorang office boy di unitInafis (Indonesia Automatic Fingerprint Identification System) Polri.PPATK kemudian menyatakan telah menemukan transaksi tak wajar dalam rekening Rafael Alun. Temuan itu bahkan disebut sudah dilaporkan ke aparat penegak hukum sejak 2012.Berdasarkan dokumen Laporan Harta Kekakayaan Penyelenggara Negara (LHKPN) KPK, Rafael memiliki harta berjumlah Rp 56 miliar. Hartanya itu paling banyak berupa properti yang nilainya ditaksir mencapai Rp 51 miliar.KPK menilai jumlah harta yang dimiliki Rafael mencurigakan. Sebab, sebagai pejabat Eselon III di lingkungan Direktorat Jenderal Pajak jumlah harta itu tidak sesuai dengan profil gajinya.KPK telah melakukan pemeriksaan terhadap Rafael Alun Trisambodo pada Rabu lalu, 1 Maret 2023. Dalam pemeriksaan itu, mantan pejabat Direktorat Jenderal Pajak Kementerian Keuangan itu mengaku tak melaporkan sejumlah harta kekayaannya kepada KPK.

Bahkan, dia menawarkan ide alternatif lain yaitu pemilu mendatang dimajukan pelaksanaannya.Partai Ummat menawarkan ide atau gagasan yang lebih dahsyat. Apa itu? jika bisa, pemilu 2024 dipercepat dari jadwal yang disusun KPU (Komisi Pemilihan Umum), kata Mustofa pada Ahad 5 Maret 2023.Mustofa menilai saat ini mayoritas masyarakat Indonesia ingin segera ada pergantian kepemimpinan. Sebab, menurut dia, agar adanya kepemimpinan nasional baru yang elegan yang dapat memimpin rakyat lebih baik.Coba deh, jadwal atau tahapan yang sudah disusun rapi itu bisa tidak dimampatkan. Diringkas waktunya dan semua agenda pemilu dibikin lebih dini pelaksanaannya, ujarnya dia melalui pesan tertulis.Meski begitu, Mustofa menyebut Partai Ummat mendukung penuh pemilu mendatang dilaksanakan sesuai jadwal yang telah ditetapkan oleh KPU. Ia memahami idenya tersebut sama saja melanggar konstitusi seperti halnya putusan Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat.Apabila ide ini dianggap melanggar konstitusi atau dianggap merusak tahapan pemilu yang sudah ada, Partai Ummat menyarankan lebih baik pemilu dilaksanakan sesuai jadwal yang telah ditetapkan saja, kata Mustofa.Mustofa membeberkan mengapa Partai Ummat menolak keras putusan PN Jakarta Pusat yang menyatakan pemilu harus ditunda. Ia menyebut hal tersebut dapat mengganggu ekosistem kepemiluan yang tengah berlangsung saat ini.Pemilu itu melibatkan banyak elemen. Partai politik yang telah lolos verifikasi telah mempersiapkan dengan sedemikian rupa, pun KPU juga tengah menyiapkan perangkat yang diperlukan. Tolong jangan diabaikan begitu saja, ujarnya.Oleh sebab itu, Mustofa menilai putusan penundaan pemilu mendatang sebagai suatu keputusan yang konyol. Ia mengatakan Partai Ummat berharap kepada semua pihak untuk melawan putusan penundaan pemilu yang dikeluarkan oleh PN Jakarta Pusat tersebut.Jika ide gagasan mempercepat pemilu dari Partai Ummat dianggap nyeleneh, maka putusan penundaan pemilu Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat bisa dianggap menabrak kepentingan hajatan nasional seluruh rakyat Indonesia, ujar dia.PN Jakarta Pusat sebelumnyamengabulkan gugatan Partai Prima terhadap KPU. Partai Prima mengajukan gugatan karena merasa dirugikan setelah dinyatakan tidak lolo verifikasi administrasi untuk menjadi peserta Pemilu 2024.

Kalaupun Anies sudah jadi keputusan politik NasDem ya kita hormati,"" ujarnya.Selanjutnya, Sandiaga sempat disebut akan hengkang ke PPPNama Sandiaga Uno memang sempat disebut-sebut sebagai salah satu calon potensial sebagai Cawapres.

Setuju?"" kata Mardiono di hadapan para kader PPP di Sulawesi Selatan pada 12 Februari 2023.Sandiaga Uno sendiri tak membantah dirinya akan pindah ke PPP. Dia menyatakan soal itu akan dibahas oleh Mardiono dengan Prabowo Subianto.""Nanti Pak Mardiono dan Pak Prabowo yang nanti akan bertemu,"" kata Sandi usai menghadiri Harlah 50 Tahun PPP bersama Prabowo di ICE BSD, Banten, Jumat, 17 Februari 2023. ""Saya hanya ikuti saja nanti pembicaraan level atas.""Anies Baswedan dan Sandiaga Uno pernah memenangkan Pilkada DKI Jakarta pada 2017.

Taj Yasin Maimoen.""Ini adalah atas perintah Bapak Presiden Jokowi untuk memastikan ketersediaan pangan menghadapi Ramadhan hingga Lebaran. Produktivitas bawang merah kita tahun ini cukup baik. Oleh karena itu, hari ini kita sama-sama mengirim bawang merah dari Brebes ke DKI Jakarta sebanyak 25 truk. Hari ini panen bersama Wamendag dan besok akan diterima Gubernur DKI Jakarta,"" kata Mentan SYL pada di Desa Krasak, Brebes.Data BPS menunjukkan luas panen dan produksi bawang merah nasional semakin meningkat dari tahun ke tahun. Di tahun 2018, luas panenya sebesar 156.779 ha dengan produksi 1,50 juta ton, 2019 seluas 159.195 ha dengan produksi 1,58 juta ton, 2020 seluas 186.900 ha dengan produksi 1,82 juta ton, 2021 seluas 194.575 ha dengan produksi 2,0 juta ton dan 2022 seluas 185.051 dengan produksi 1,99 juta ton.""Bawang Merah meskipun secara agregat tahunan kita terhitung swasembada, namun produksi antar-bulan dan antar-wilayah masih belum merata sepanjang tahun. Produksi bawang merah masih terkonsentrasi di beberapa daerah seperti Brebes, Nganjuk, Bima, Enrekang, Solok, Garut dan sentra-sentra lainnya. Di sinilah pentingnya sinergi dan kolaborasi dari berbagai stakeholder terkait, untuk menciptakan orkestra penyediaan pangan nasional, khususnya bawang merah, mulai dari hulu hingga hilir,"" tutur SYL.Ia melanjutkan, Kementan mempunyai mitra taktis dan strategis sebagai bagian dari upaya pengendalian inflasi nasional. Mitra ini disebut petani Champion, terdiri atas orang-orang terpilih yang dipandang mampu mengkonsolidasikan segenap sumber daya yang ada untuk mendukung upaya pemerintah dalam menjaga pasokan dan harga kebutuhan pangan pokok yang rentan terhadap inflasi, khususnya komoditas aneka cabai dan bawang merah.""Tahun 2023 ini, para Champion telah menyatakan komitmennya untuk mengkonsolidasikan pasokan bawang merah sebanyak 5.750 ton dan aneka cabai sebanyak 2.750 ton sebagai stok cadangan Kementerian Pertanian jika sewaktu-waktu diperlukan terutama pada momentum Hari Besar Keagamaan Nasional seperti Puasa, Lebaran, Idul Adha, Natal dan Tahun Baru,"" tutur SYL.Wamendag Jerry Sambuaga memberikan mengaparesiasi kepada SYL yang menyelenggarakan panen bawang merah dan berhasil meningkatkan produksinya, serta menjadikan neraca perdagangan tahun 2022 surplus Rp 54,46 miliar, tertinggi sepanjang sejarah Republik Indonesia. Dengan demikian, pemerintah dapat memastikan langsung ketersediaan stok pangan dan mengendalikan inflasi, khususnya menghadapi Ramadhan hingga Idul Fitri tahun 2023.""Salah satu tugas kita (Kemendag) melihat mengecek guna memastikan langsung ketersediaan pangan di daerah dan pasar, termasuk bawang merah. Kemarin saya keliling dari Samarinda, Garut, Sumatera Barat dan sampai ke Indonesia timur di Makassar, Gowa dan seterusnya memastikan harga-harga itu terkendali,"" ujarnya.Jerry menambahkan Kemendag terus mendukung agar ketersediaan pangan khususnya bawang merah ini aman dengan harga yang menguntungkan petani, pedagang dan masyarakat, salah satunya menyiapkan Sistem Resi Gudang (SRG). Sistem ini penting karena ketika panen raya tentu butuh penyimpanan, sehingga Kemendag juga ikut mendukung dengan membangun gudang di daerah-daerah sehingga hasil panen bisa disimpan aman dan terpelihara dengan baik dalam ruangan yang cukup lama yakni 3 sampai 6 bulan seperti bawang merah.""Ini salah satu bentuk bagaimana kita membangun bersinergi dengan Kementan sehingga hulu dan hilirnya terpelihara dan terjaga dengan baik. Oleh karena itu, kita harus menjaga sinergitas untuk kepentingan masyarakat,"" tuturnya.Sementara itu, Pj Bupati Brebes, Urip Sihabudin mengatakan kunjungan ini menjadi penting karena pemantauan ketersediaan bawang merah di kabupaten Brebes dilakukan langsung oleh Menteri Pertanian dan Wakil Menteri Perdagangan untuk mengamakan pasokan bawang merah menjelang Ramadan dan Hari Raya Idul Fitri 2023.Kabupaten Brebes memberikan dukungan penuh untuk stabilitas pasokan dan harga bawang merah nasional dengan kesiapan produksi lebih dari 15.000 ton bawang merah di bulan Maret untuk pemenuhan kebutuhan menjelang hari besar keagamaan nasional bulan Ramadhan dan Idul Fitri.""Luas panen dan produksi bawang merah Kabupaten Brebes menduduki urutan pertama di tingkat Provinsi Jawa Tengah maupun nasional. Di tahun 2022, luas panennya mencapai 32.573 ha dengan perkiraan produksi sebesar 384.448 ton menjadikan Kabupaten Brebes sebagai sentra nomor satu terbesar di Indonesia,"" ucapnya.""Mulai saat hingga Ramadhan dan Idul Fitri, kami siap menyuplai bawang merah ke Ibukota Jakarta sebanyak 25 sampai 27 ton per hari.

Menurut Adi, fenomena yang sering ditemui jelang pemiluini karena dua faktor.Faktor pertama karena rendahnya party identity yang dimiliki oleh politisi. Kondisi ini, kata Adi, yang menyebabkan berpindah partai dianggap jadi suatu hak yang biasa di konstelasi politik Indonesia.""Orang kita melihat politik itu, partai tidak lebih dari sekedar kendaraan politik bukan sebagai sebuah instrumen perjuangan ideologis untuk menegakkan dan memperjuangkan nilai-nilai politik tertentu,"" kata Adi saat dihubungi, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Adi berujar, karena parpol sering dianggap sebagai kendaraan yang dirental salam mobilisasi politik untuk maju dalam kontestasi baik itu pileg, pilpres atau pilkada, maka tak mengherankan mudahnya elit politik berganti partai politik.Faktor kedua, kata Adi, adalah penilaian parpol yang dianggap tidak menguntungkan elit secara politik. Sehingga dengan pertimbangan itu, menurut Adi, banyak politisi yang keluar partai mencari partai baru.""Mencari pelabuhan baru di partai politik baru yang bisa menampung aspirasi. Dan tentu saja yang paling penting memberikan akses terhadap hak politik yang seluas-luasnya,"" ucap Adi.Adi menyatakan pola politik yang ada pada politikus saat ini adalah untung dan rugi. Sehingga kalau partai lamanya sudah tidak menguntungkan secara politik, tidak kondusif secara politik, politisi bersangkutan pasti akan mencari pelabuhan partai politik baru.""Yang memberikan jaminan eksistensi baru dan jaminan kemenangan,"" katanyaAdi melihat proses perekrutan kader parpol merupakan hal yang tak bisa dianggap sepele. Menurut Adi untuk menghasilkan kader-kader berkualitas, proses rekrutmennya mesti berlangsung selektif. ""Kaderisasi dan rekrutmen politik harus ketat,"" kata dia.

Dalam pertemuan tersebut, menurut dia, Sri Mulyani menyatakan sedang merencanakan reformasi jilid II di Kementerian Keuangan. Menurut Laode pertemuan itu terjadi karena dia diminta memberikan masukan kepada Sri Mulyani agar reformasi jilid II di Kemenkeu berhasil. Reformasi yang dimaksud adalah ""bersih-bersih"" di Kemenkeu.""Bu Menteri mengatakan akan ada reformasi jilid II di Kemenkeu, khususnya di Direktorat Jenderal Pajak dan Direktorat Jenderal Bea Cukai,"" kata Laode pada Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023. Menkeu Sri Mulyani mengundang beberapa orang pada Jumat lalu, 3 Maret 2023, tersebut.Laode menjelaskan Sri Mulyani berencana memperketat pengawasan LHKPN para pegawai di Kemenkeu. Nantinya mekanisme pelaporan LHKPN pejabat Kemenkeu akan lebih dimutakhirkan.Fungsi dan kinerja Inspektorat Jenderal Kemenkeu khususnya dalam LHKPN seluruh pegawai juga akan ditingkatkan. Verifikasi akan lebih mendalam selain kepatuhan dalam menyetorkan dan melaporkan dokumen perpajakan.Direktur Eksekutif Kemitraan itu pun menyebut dalam reformasi jilid II Kemenkeu akan meminimalisasi penyalahgunaan wewenang. Menkeu Sri Mulyani berencana menyisir regulasi yang berpotensi menimbulkan konflik kepentingan pegawai Kemenkeu.Wakil Ketua KPK periode 2015-2019 itu memberikan sejumlah masukan kepada Sri Mulyani, antara lain meminta Ditjen Pajak melakukan penyidikan internal harta kekayaan para pegawainya yang dinilai tidak wajar.""Mereka pasti tidak membayar pajak harta yang disembunyikan atas nama orang lain,"" kata Laode. Inspektorat Jenderal Kemenkeu juga harus jeli terhadap keabsahan LHKPN pegawai Kemenkeu mengenai kewajaran perbandingan harta kekayaan dengan penghasilan pegawai.""Inspektorat Jenderal harus meperhatikan gaya hidup masing-masing pegawai.""Sri Mulyani membagikan pertemuan dengan sejumlah pegiat antikorupsi tadi via akun Instagram miliknya @smindrawati.Ada sepuluh orang yang diundang Sri Mulyani malam itu.

Menurut Feri, dalam Peraturan Mahkamah Agung Nomor 2 Tahun 2019 Pasal 10 dam Pasal 11 telah diatur yurisdiksi pengadilan negeri dalam penanganan perkara perbuatan melanggar hukum (PMH).Menurut aturan tersebut, jika ada pihak yang mengajukan perkara PMH ke Pengadilan Negeri, maka pengadilan negeri bakal melimpahkannya ke Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara (PTUN) karena bukan yurisdiksinya.""Jika pun Pengadilan Negeri sudah menjalankan perkara tersebut karena luput, khilaf, misalnya, maka harus diputus tidak dapat diterima,"" kata Feri dalam diskusi virtual, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Menurut Feri, aturan ini sudah ada dari tahun 2019 dan telah menjadi tradisi di pengadilan negeri untuk melimpahkan perkara PMH ke PTUN. Jika ada pemohon yang nekat mengajukan PMH ke Pengadilan Negeri, maka menurut Feri, Pengadilan Negeri bakal menolaknya.""Makanya aneh, tiba-tiba khusus untuk PMH ini diajukan di PN Jakarta Pusat, kemudian dijalankan bahkan diputuskan perkaranya. Jadi, ini sudah dilanggar,"" kata Feri.Dianggap langgar konstitusiSelain itu, Feri menyebut Majelis Hakim Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat juga telah melanggar UUD Negara RI Tahun 1945 yang telah menyatakan pemilu dilaksanakan setiap lima tahun sekali. Dengan adanya UUD ini, maka vonis Pengadilan cacat karena melanggar konstitusi.Selain itu, Feri menyebut gugatan yang diajukan Partai Prima ke Pengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat mengenai gagalnya partai tersebut dalam proses verifikasi oleh KPU. Namun, ia heran keputusan Hakim justru menunda pemilu.""Kalau memang masalahnya soal verifikasi administrasi, kalau itu masalah keperdataannya perbaiki saja itu oleh putusan peradilan. Tapi, kok tiba-tiba meloncat ke masalah hukum publik, yaitu masalah tahapan penyelenggaraan pemilu jadi dari hukum privat perdata ke hukum publik, bagaimana ceritanya?"" kata Feri.Isi putusan PN JakpusPengadilan Negeri Jakarta Pusat memerintahkan Komisi Pemilihan Umum untuk menunda Pemilu 2024. Perintah tersebut tertuang dalam putusan perdata yang diajukan Partai Prima dengan tergugat Komisi Pemilihan Umum.Menghukum tergugat (KPU) untuk tidak melaksanakan sisa tahapan Pemilihan Umum 2024 sejak putusan ini diucapkan dan melaksanakan tahapan Pemilihan Umum dari awal selama lebih kurang 2 tahun 4 bulan tujuh hari, seperti dikutip dari salinan putusan, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Putusan tersebut dibacakan oleh Majelis Hakim pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023. Adapun Ketua Majelis Hakim yang menyidangkan gugatan tersebut adalah T. Oyong, dengan hakim anggota H. Bakri dan Dominggus Silaban.Dalam putusannya, majelis hakim menyatakan KPU telah melakukan perbuatan melawan hukum. Adapun perbuatan melawan hukum yang dimaksud adalah KPU menyatakan Partai Prima tidak memenuhi syarat dalam tahapan verifikasi administrasi partai politik calon peserta pemilu.Atas keputusan itu, Partai Prima mengajukan gugatan secara perdata ke PN Jakarta Pusat pada Desember 2022. Dan hasilnya, Majelis Hakim PN Jakarta Pusat mengabulkan gugatan tersebut dengan memerintahkan KPU menunda Pemilu 2024.Selain penundaan, pengadilan juga menghukum KPU membayar ganti rugi materiil sebanyak Rp 500 juta.

Ada Paslon Puan Maharani- Andhika Perkasa dengan elektabilitas mencapai 2,1 persen. Lalu paslon Ganjar Pranowo-Sandiaga Salahudin Uno dengan elektabilitas 30,9 persen. Juga Paslon Prabowo Subianto-Muhaimin Iskandar elektabilitasnya 23,3 persen.Kemudian dalam simulasi dengan tiga pasangan capres-cawapres, Anies-AHY masih masih unggul dengan elektabilitasnya mencapai 37,3 persen.Dalam simulasi tersebut, Ganjar Pranowo- Airlangga Hartarto dengan elektabilitas 28 persen. Kemudian paslon Prabowo Subianto-Puan Maharani dengan elektabilitas 23, 4 persen.Pangi menyebut alasannya terdongkraknya eletabilitas pasangan Anies-AHY karena basis pemilih pada AHY relatif lebih menyebar jika dibandingakan dengan Khofifah salah satu kandidat cawapres.""Anies-AHY terjadi penguatan di DKI, Banten dan Jawa Barat sedangkan Anies-Khofifah hanya menguat di Jawa Timur,"" ungkapnya.Demokrat Inginkan AHY Jadi CawapresSekretaris Majelis Tinggi Partai Demokrat Andi Mallarangeng mengatakan sosok calon wakil presiden diserahkan sepenuhnya pada Anies Baswedan. Kendati demikian, Andi menyebut partainya sudah menyampaikan jika ingin menang, maka pasangan yang disodorkan pada 2024 hendaknya Anies bersama Ketua Umum Demokrat Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono alias AHY.Kalau kami Partai Demokrat, yang kami sampaikan adalah, kalau mau menang ya Anies-AHY, kata Andi di Kantor DPP Partai Demokrat, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023, Anies menyambangi Kantor Demokrat untuk berkenalan dengan jajaran Majelis Tinggi Partai. Andi menjelaskan, aspirasi majelis partai menginginkan bekas Gubernur DKI Jakarta itu berpasangan dengan AHY.Kendati demikian, Andi menyatakan keputusan soal cawapres ini tetap diserahkan kepada Anies.Itu aspirasi dari anggota-anggota Majelis Tinggi Partai. Tapi semua dikembalikan ke Pak Anies, kata dia.Sementara itu, Anies irit bicara kala ditanya ihwal sosok yang bakal mendampinginya pada Pilpres 2024.

Pokok masalah lemahnya sistem LHKPN di Indonesia adalah kelemahan hukum pemberantasan korupsi, terutama bidang unexplained wealth dan illicit enrichment""Keduanya belum dianggap sebagai kejahatan. Jadi sulit merampas aset penjahat. Karena sampai sekarang belum ada Undang-Undang Perampasan Aset,"" ujar Laode pada kepada Tempo pada Sabtu lalu, 4 Maret 2023, via pesan tertulis.Harta kekayaan pejabat negara, terutama di kemenkeu, menjadi sorotan publik setelah harta kejayaan pejabat pajak Rafael Alun Trisambodo terungkap di media. Menurut LHKPN dia memiliki harta kekayaan Rp 56 miliar yang dinilai tidak wajar karena dia pejabat Eselon III.Menurut Laode Muhammad Syarief, LHKPN belum ada sistem red flag yang otomatis menandai harta pejabat negara yang janggal. Maka sulit memetakan harta kekayaan pejabat yang mencurigakan. Kelemahan yang lain, Laode melanjutkan, adalah akibat minimnya personel yang mengelola LHKPN. Walhasil pengawasan terhadap LHKPN tidak maksimal.KPK pernah mengakui masih banyak celah mekanisme pelaporan LHKPN. Deputi Pencegahan dan Monitoring KPK Pahala Nainggolan pun menyebut belum ada sanksi tegas bagi pejabat yang memanipulasi pengisian LHKPN.""Sanksinya jangan hanya administratif,"" ucap Pahala di Gedung Merah Putih KPK, Jakarta, pada Rabu lalu, 1 Maret 2023. Pahala menilai hukuman bagi pelanggar LHKPN tidak efektif sebab tindaklanjut laporan pelanggaran wajib diserahkan kepada pemimpin instansi masing-masing.""Yang jadi masalah kalau pimpinannya juga tidak tertarik dengan LHKPN.""Wakil Ketua KPK Alexander Marwata juga menyebut sistem LHKPN saat ini belum sempurna. Salah satunya, LHKPN tidak mencakup kenaikan nilai harta sehingga seringkali harta kekayaan pejabat membengkak meski sejatinya tidak memiliki penambahan wujud materiil.Dia mencontohkan, pejabat beli tanah pada 2010 seharga Rp 1 miliar sehingga sekarang bisa menjadi Rp 5 miliar.

Ihwal sanksi yang dijatuhkan, Luthfi tak merincinya lebih lanjut. ""Sanksinya ada yang demosi, ada yang (berdampak pada) jabatannya, macam-macam,"" kata dia.Luthfi mengatakan jika kasus suap penerimaan bintara itu merupakan akibat kelalaian anggota Polda Jawa Tengah yang terlibat. ""Itu masalah kelalaian anggota yang kami jadikan pembelajaran dan memberi efek jera pada yang terlibat,"" kata dia.Kapolda berujar transparan dalam mengusut kasus yang mencoreng institusi itu.

112,tempo,Voxpol: Anies-AHY Punya Peluang Unggul dalam Simulasi Pilpres 2024,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2019/02/09/id_818306/818306_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698698/voxpol-anies-ahy-punya-peluang-unggul-dalam-simulasi-pilpres-2024,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Direktur Eksekutif Voxpol Center Reseach and Consulting Pangi Syarwi Chaniago menyebut pasangan Anies Baswedan - Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (AHY) memiliki peluang unggul lebih tinggi dalam sejumlah simulasi Pilpres 2024.""Pasangan Anies-AHY cenderung lebih signifikan menang dari beberapa simulasi, baik simulasi 4 pasang, 3 pasang maupun 2 pasang,"" ujarnya saat dihubungi, Sabtu, 4 Maret 2023.Data Survei Voxpol per September 2022 lalu menunjukan dengan simulasi model empat pasangan, persentase kemenangan paslon Anies -AHY selalu unggul, dimana eletabilitasnya rata-ratanya di 30 persen ke atas.Misalnya saja, salah satu simulasi dengan empat pasangan. Ada Paslon Puan Maharani- Andhika Perkasa dengan elektabilitas mencapai 2,1 persen. Lalu paslon Ganjar Pranowo-Sandiaga Salahudin Uno dengan elektabilitas 30,9 persen. Juga Paslon Prabowo Subianto-Muhaimin Iskandar elektabilitasnya 23,3 persen.Kemudian dalam simulasi dengan tiga pasangan capres-cawapres, Anies-AHY masih masih unggul dengan elektabilitasnya mencapai 37,3 persen.Dalam simulasi tersebut, Ganjar Pranowo- Airlangga Hartarto dengan elektabilitas 28 persen. Kemudian paslon Prabowo Subianto-Puan Maharani dengan elektabilitas 23, 4 persen.Pangi menyebut alasannya terdongkraknya eletabilitas pasangan Anies-AHY karena basis pemilih pada AHY relatif lebih menyebar jika dibandingakan dengan Khofifah salah satu kandidat cawapres.""Anies-AHY terjadi penguatan di DKI, Banten dan Jawa Barat sedangkan Anies-Khofifah hanya menguat di Jawa Timur,"" ungkapnya.Demokrat Inginkan AHY Jadi CawapresSekretaris Majelis Tinggi Partai Demokrat Andi Mallarangeng mengatakan sosok calon wakil presiden diserahkan sepenuhnya pada Anies Baswedan. Kendati demikian, Andi menyebut partainya sudah menyampaikan jika ingin menang, maka pasangan yang disodorkan pada 2024 hendaknya Anies bersama Ketua Umum Demokrat Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono alias AHY.Kalau kami Partai Demokrat, yang kami sampaikan adalah, kalau mau menang ya Anies-AHY, kata Andi di Kantor DPP Partai Demokrat, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Pada Kamis, 2 Maret 2023, Anies menyambangi Kantor Demokrat untuk berkenalan dengan jajaran Majelis Tinggi Partai. Andi menjelaskan, aspirasi majelis partai menginginkan bekas Gubernur DKI Jakarta itu berpasangan dengan AHY.Kendati demikian, Andi menyatakan keputusan soal cawapres ini tetap diserahkan kepada Anies.Itu aspirasi dari anggota-anggota Majelis Tinggi Partai. Tapi semua dikembalikan ke Pak Anies, kata dia.Sementara itu, Anies irit bicara kala ditanya ihwal sosok yang bakal mendampinginya pada Pilpres 2024.

Hujan yang terus terjadi dari enam hari lalu membuat air di irigasi meluap, dan mengenang persawahan petani.""Dibalik semua bencana pasti ada hikmah yang besar, saya mewakili pemerintah hadir untuk memberi support kepada bapak ibu"" kata Syahrul.Ia pun berharap banjir tidak menurunkan semangat para petani. ""Saya minta seluruh Dirjen saya untuk bantu petani disini,"" ujarnya.Syahrul mengatakan, akan menurunkan pompa-pompa besar bagi daerah yang masih bisa diselamatkan. Syahrul juga akan terus memantau banjir hari per hari melalui Agriculture War Room (AWR) di Jakarta.""Satu minggu kedepan akan kita pantau, setelah mulai surut secepatnya kita lakukan tanam ulang"" kata Syahrul.Adapun, untuk lahan yang terdampak parah Syahrul akan mengganti benih padi secara gratis dan mesin pompa air. Sebab, ia memahami hal ini bukan sesuatu yang mudah, tetapi jika semua bergerak pasti semua dapat dilalui.Asisten II bidang perekonomian Kabupaten Karawang Hanafi, yang mewakili Bupati Karawang mengucapkan terimakasih kepada Menteri Pertanian atas bantuan dan kepedulian yang diberikan. Menurutnya, saat ini Karawang sudah menetapkan status tanggap darurat banjir.Tercatat ada sebanyak 6.879 hektar (51 persen) dari pertanaman se-Kabupaten Karawang yang tergenang.

Melalui OSS, Kementan berharap dapat terus meningkatkan layanan prima.""Kedepan, semua layanan perizinan kita akan melalui OSS dimana portal P3T (pelayanan perizinan terintegrasi) dilakukan secara baik dalam memudahkan pelaku usaha,"" kata Sekjen Kementan, Kasdi Subagyono saat membuka Sosialisasi dan Workshop Perizinan Berusaha untuk Menunjang Kegiatan Berusaha (PB UMKU) Pupuk dan Benih Hortikultura, Kamis, 2 Maret 2023.Kasdi mengatakan, sektor pertanian selama masa pandemi Covid-19 tumbuh meyakinkan dengan capaian PDB triwulan II 2020 sebesar 16,24 persen. Selain itu, capaian ekspor dan kesejahteraan petani terus meningkat.Kondisi tersebut, Kasdi melanjutkan, membuka peluang usaha bagi pembuatan pupuk maupun ekspor benih hortikultura. ""Produktivitas padi atau gabah Indonesia dari tahun ke tahun juga mengalami peningkatan. Bahkan Indonesia menduduki peringkat ke-dua dari 9 negara di Asia. Jadi pertanian itu sangat menjanjikan,"" ujarnya.Kepala Pusat Perlindungan Varietas Tanaman dan Perizinan Pertanian (PVTPP), Leli Nuryati, mengatakan, peningkatan kualitas pelayanan merupakan fasilitasi yang diberikan pemerintah dalam menciptakan iklim usaha yang sehat serta mengembangkan sektor pertanian secara baik.""Yang pasti kami ingin meningkatkan ekosistem dan iklim usaha dengan proses perizinan yang lebih efektif dan mengubah dari pendekatan ex-ante atau pemenuhan persyaratan di muka, menjadi ex post atau verifikasi,"" kata dia.Meski demikian, Leli melanjutkan, pihaknya juga terus melakukan evaluasi terhadap layanan yang ada saat ini. Misalnya dengan memberi ruang bagi masyarakat, khususnya para pelaku usaha untuk memberi masukan seperti yang dilakukan pada kegiatan ini.""Tapi kita terus tekankan bahwa pelayanan prima harus dilakukan secara terus-menerus,"" ujarnya. Karena itu, pihaknya melakukan evaluasi terhadap layanan pendaftaran pupuk maupun pemasukan dan pengeluaran benih hortikultura.""Kita juga melakukan pengawasan guna mewujudkan pelayanan publik yang transparan dan akuntabel,"" kata Leli.Menurut Leli, selama ini pemerintah juga membuka ruang pengawasan bersama baik dengan pemerintah daerah maupun kementerian dan lembaga negara lainya.

Kelapa sawit merupakan komoditas penting dalam memperkuat ekonomi nasional, ditargetkan program PSR mencapai 180 ribu hektare pertahun.""Pesan saya bagi anggota Gapki maupun perusahaan besar dan industri kelapa sawit supaya memperkuat jalur kemitraan antara petani dengan perusahaan besar. Termasuk pada program peremajaan sawit rakyat,"" kata Wakil Presiden RI, KH. Maruf Amin saat membuka Munas Gapki XI di Istana Wapres Jakarta, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Kemitraan, kata wapres, merupakan kata kunci sekaligus solusi bagi industri sawit yang mendasari manfaat berkelanjutan dan saling menguntungkan. Dengan begitu, dia ingin sawit rakyat terus mendapat ruang promosi sehingga ke bisa meningkatkan nilai kesejahteraan. ""Yang kedua bisa melakukan pendampingan dan bimbingan sertifikasi untuk menciptakan sistem usaha perkebunan yang layak dan memiliki nilai ekonomi dan ramah lingkungan,"" katanya.Wapres berharap, pengusaha sawit dapat meningkatkan program CSR untuk kepentingan masyarakat yang lebih luas. Salah satunya dengan melatih para santri di setiap pondok pesantren yang memiliki lahan pertanaman. Menurutnya, santri dan ponpes juga memiliki potensi yang sama dalam meningkatkan produktivitas.""Perusahaan harus meningkatkan program CSR untuk masyarakat sekitar. Juga yang tak kalah penting adalah saat ini ada 34.000 pondok pesantren di Indonesia dengan jumlah santri tidak kurang dari 4,76 juta orang, dimana sekitar 44,2 persen pesantren punya beragam potensi ekonomi mulai dari pengembangan koperasi UMKM, peternakan dan perkebunan,"" katanya.Selama ini, tambah Menteri Pertanian Syahrul Yasin Limpo (Mentan SYL), industri perkebunan sawit selalu menjadi modal dasar bagi bangsa Indonesia dalam memperkokoh ekonomi di saat pandemi. Apalagi, 70 persen keberhasilan pertanian Indonesia ditopang dari subsektor perkebunan.""Oleh karena itu, munas ini harus menjadi forum konsolidasi konsepsi baik arah maupun target. Terlebih presiden dan wakil presiden minta kepada kita semua agar mencapai program PSR 180 ribu hektare,"" katanya.Ketua Umum Gabungan Pengusaha Kelapa Sawit Indonesia Joko Supriono menyampaikan terimakasih atas perhatian pemerintah dalam mengembangkan industri sawit nasional. Joko mengaku siap akan melaksanakan arahan Wapres dalam memenuhi target program PSR 180 ribu ha.""Karena itu kami terus fokus mendorong dan menjaga tujuan industri sawit nasional akan tetap mampu memberikan kontribusi yang maksimal khususnya dalam menyediakan lapangan kerja dan sumbangan devisa kepada negara. Kami siap bersama pemerintah capai target program PSR,"" katanya.Program PSR menjadi perhatian khusus Presiden dan Wakil Presiden dalam meningkatkan produktivitas kelapa sawit. Kontribusi kelapa sawit selama ini ditopang dari luasan areal tutupan yang mencapai 16,38 juta hektar, dimana sekitar 6,9 juta hektar merupakan milik pekebun sawit rakyat. Meski demikian, perkebunan sawit masih memiliki tantangan yang cukup besar seperti penggunaan agroinput yang belum maksimal.Pada sisi lain, produktivitas sawit nasional baru mencapai 34 ton per hektar atau setara dengan CPO.

37,tempo,Menpan RB: Minat ASN Muda Pindah ke IKN Nusantara Cukup Tinggi,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2022/09/20/id_1142427/1142427_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698324/menpan-rb-minat-asn-muda-pindah-ke-ikn-nusantara-cukup-tinggi,"TEMPO.CO, Malang - Menteri Pendayagunaan Aparatur Negara dan Reformasi Birokrasi (Menpan RB) Abdullah Azwar Anas mengatakan minat aparatur sipil negara berusia muda pindah ke Ibu Kota Negara Nusantara cukup tinggi. Menurutnya hingga saat ini belum ada ASN yang menolak dipindahkan ke IKN Nusantara.Bahkan, kata Azwar Anas, banyak ASN muda yang ingin membangun karir di IKN. ""Saya belum mendengar ada yang menolak. Justru banyak yang ingin ke sana, terutama anak-anak muda milenial,"" kata mantan Bupati Banyuwangi itu pada wartawan di Malang, Jawa Timur, Jumat, 3 Maret 2023.Menpan RB menjelaskan para ASN muda yang berminat untuk pindah ke IKN dikarenakan nantinya di tempat baru mereka bekerja dengan sistem berbasis teknologi atau yang biasa dikenal dengan sebutan sistem pemerintahan berbasis elektronik (SPBE).Menurut Azwar Anas anak-anak muda tersebut menganggap penerapan sistem berbasis teknologi menjadi sebuah peluang yang menjanjikan sehingga minat para ASN muda untuk pindah ke Nusantara cukup tinggi.""Di IKN Nusantara nantinya menggunakan SPBE, justru ini kesempatan bagus untuk para ASN muda yang akan berada di sana,"" katanya.Secara keseluruhan, kata dia, ada sebanyak 16.990 ASN dan petugas pertahanan keamanan (hankam), termasuk TNI Polri yang akan pindah ke IKN Nusantara di Kalimantan Timur. Para ASN itu berasal dari 35 kementerian/lembaga, termasuk kementerian koordinator.Jika dirinci, dari total 16.900 orang yang akan pindah ke IKN Nusantara tersebut sebanyak 11 ribu orang merupakan ASN, sementara sisanya dari unsur TNI/ Polri. Proses pembangunan di IKN sedang berlangsung, termasuk tempat tinggal para ASN tersebut.""Saat ini sedang disiapkan, rumah dinas berupa 'tower-tower' apartemen. Pembangunan itu tidak ada masalah karena anggaran sudah disiapkan dan telah diproses,"" katanya.Sebelumnya Indonesia mengajak Federasi Bisnis Jepang (Keidanren) untuk berinvestasi di IKN Nusantara.

Deputi Pencegahan dan Monitoring KPK Pahala Nainggolan mengatakan saat itu KPK terhalang kewenangan.Pahala mengatakan laporan PPATK pada 2012 lalu merupakan hasil analisis transaksi tahun 2003-2011. Sementara itu, kata dia, Rafael Alun bukanlah seorang wajib lapor dalam periode tersebut.""Buat tugas nya LHKPN. Sebagian kendala sih iya karena wewenang meriksa hanya yang wajib lapor. Ini kan transaksi 2003-2011. padahal yang bersangkutan baru wajib lapor tahun 2011,"" kata Pahala dalam keterangan tertulis pada Jum'at, 3 Maret 2023.Selain itu, Pahala mengatakan laporan analisis PPATK tersebut sejatinya ditujukan bukan untuk KPK. Sehingga, kata dia, surat yang disampaikan kepada KPK hanya berupa tembusan.""Yang minta informasi keuangan RAT ini Kejaksaan Agung pada Mei 2012. Lalu dibalas PPATK dengan penyampaian hasil analisis Januari tahun 2013. Tapi KPK ikut dikirimin juga laporan hasil analisanya,"" ujarnya.Meski begitu, Pahala mengatakan KPK telah mempelajari laporan PPATK tahun 2012. Ia mengatakan hal tersebut ditujukan untuk mempelajari pihak yang terlibat dengan Rafael Alun.""Tapi karena periodenya jauh pada saat ini kita perihitungkan dalam pemeriksaan tapi polanya saja kita ambil, kira-kira kaya mana sih orang ini jalannya,"" ujar dia.Selain itu dalam kesempatan sebelumnya, Pahala menyebut KPK pernah memanggil Rafael Alun pada 2018 lalu.

40,tempo,Begini Cara BPJS Kesehatan Tangani Stunting ,https://statik.tempo.co/data/2023/03/03/id_1185936/1185936_720.jpg,https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1698334/begini-cara-bpjs-kesehatan-tangani-stunting,"INFO NASIONAL  BPJS Kesehatan berperan dalam hal memberikan penjaminan akses layanan kesehatan sebagai upaya penanganan stunting, mulai dari akses kesehatan bagi ibu saat hamil, saat persalinan maupun pasca persalinan. Berbagai penjaminan layanan bagi bayi dan balita juga dapat dilakukan baik di Fasilitas Kesehatan Tingkat Pertama (FKTP) maupun Fasilitas Kesehatan Rujukan Tingkat Lanjutan (FKRTL)/rumah sakit yang bekerja sama.Akses layanan kesehatan bagi ibu hamil sangat penting untuk memastikan kondisi bayi dalam kandungan maupun kondisi kesehatan ibu sendiri dalam keadaan baik. Termasuk saat proses maupun pasca melahirkan. Harapannya ada pemantauan risiko kesehatan, termasuk jika ada potensi risiko stunting pada bayi sejak dalam kandungan, kata Direktur Jaminan Perlayanan Kesehatan, Lily Kresnowati.Dalam layanan kesehatan untuk kehamilan, BPJS Kesehatan menjamin pemeriksaan kehamilan atau Ante Natal Care (ANC) baik di FKTP maupun di rumah sakit sesuai indikasi medis serta sesuai dengan sistem rujukan yang berlaku. Pemeriksaan ANC di FKTP saat ini bisa dilakukan sebanyak 6 kali, termasuk diantaranya pemeriksaan utrasonografi (USG) sebanyak 2 kali oleh Dokter.Sementara untuk persalinan, dapat dilakukan di FKTP maupun di rumah sakit sesuai indikasi medis. Persalinan di FKTP termasuk dilakukan oleh Bidan, Puskesmas maupun Klinik Pratama untuk Layanan persalinan normal maupun dengan penyulit.BPJS Kesehatan juga menjamin pelayanan pasca persalinan atau Post Natal Care (PNC) yang dapat dilakukan di FKTP atau di rumah sakit. Pelayanan PNC dilakukan sebanyak 4 kali pemeriksaan yang mencakup 3 kali pemeriksaan ibu dan bayi dan 1 kali pemeriksaan ibu.Pada tahun 2022, BPJS Kesehatan menanggung biaya maternal dan neonatal yang dilakukan di FKTP sebesar Rp681,87 Miliar yang terdiri dari 2.678.592 kasus. Biaya tersebut mencakup persalinan normal, ANC maupun PNC. Jika diakumulasi selama 5 tahun sejak 2018-2022 total biaya manfaat maternal ini mencapai Rp3,6 Triliun.Lily mengatakan, penjaminan biaya kesehatan maternal ini penting sebagai salah satu upaya pencegahan stunting khususnya bagi bayi yang baru dilahirkan. Dalam Permenkes 3/2023 juga terdapat peningkatan tarif untuk layanan kesehatan maternal dan neonatal, termasuk skrining. Besar harapan kami adanya peningkatan tarif ini dapat lebih mengoptimalkan layanan bagi peserta JKN, ujar dia.Dalam pelayanan persalinan, BPJS Kesehatan juga menjamin pengambilan sampel Skrining Hipotiroid Kongenital (SHK), sebagai upaya skrining gangguan tumbuh kembang dan bahkan gangguan kognitif. Penjaminan skrining tersebut bersinergi dengan program dan pembiayaan dari Pemerintah dan Pemerintah Daerah sesuai kewenangannya.BPJS Kesehatan juga menanggung biaya pelayanan kesehatan bagi bayi dan balita sesuai dengan kebutuhan medis termasuk pemeriksaan fisik balita untuk stunting dan wasting. Selain itu, BPJS Kesehatan juga menjamin pelayanan imunisasi rutin dengan ketersediaan dan distribusi vaksin dilakukan oleh Pemerintah.BPJS Kesehatan, kata Lily, bersinergi dengan para pemangku kepentingan dengan harapan perbaikan mutu layanan yang diterima peserta JKN semakin meningkat.
